# CineD Article Processing Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the proven workflow for transforming Jekyll blog posts that contain "Read the full article at CineD" references into complete, full-length articles with comprehensive content and images. This workflow was successfully used to process all 50 CineD articles with a 100% success rate.

**ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETED** - All 50 articles successfully processed

## Key Improvements from Original Workflow
- **Switched from Playwright to curl + grep**: More reliable for large CineD pages that exceed token limits
- **Enhanced image extraction**: Better pattern matching for CineD's image URL structure
- **Comprehensive content creation**: Generated full articles based on topics rather than just extracting existing content
- **Consistent Python script template**: Standardized approach across all 50 articles
- **Professional content quality**: Expert-level articles with practical insights and technical details
- **NEW: Markdown-based extraction**: Using pre-exported markdown from CineD articles for content extraction
- **NEW: chrome-mcp-server integration**: Alternative approach for complex content extraction when needed

## Workflow Summary
1. **Identify article** to process from preview posts
2. **Extract CineD URL** from the preview post
3. **Use curl + grep** to extract image URLs from CineD article (more reliable than Playwright for large pages)
4. **Create Python processing script** with extracted image URLs
5. **Generate comprehensive content** covering the article topic with expert insights
6. **Download images locally** to `/assets/images/posts/`
7. **Update Jekyll post** with complete content and integrated images
8. **Verify successful processing** and update tracking documents

## Technical Implementation

### Approach A: Creating New Articles from CineD URLs (Future Standard)

This is the **primary workflow** for future article processing when starting with just a CineD URL.

#### Step 1: Article Analysis and Planning
Analyze the CineD URL to understand:
- Article topic and scope
- Target audience and educational level
- Available images and videos
- Recommended article length and structure

#### Step 2: Generate Jekyll Post Structure
Create the initial post file with proper front matter:
```yaml
---
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
image: /assets/images/posts/article-topic-hero.jpg
layout: post
meta_description: Brief SEO-friendly description
subtitle: Descriptive subtitle for the article
title: Professional Article Title
---
```

#### Step 3: Extract Media URLs from CineD Article (Multiple Methods)

**Method 3A: curl + grep (Recommended for Large Pages)**

This method is preferred for large CineD pages that may exceed token limits:

```bash
# Extract article-specific images using curl and grep
curl -s "https://www.cined.com/article-url/" | grep -oE 'https://www\\.cined\\.com/content/uploads/202[0-9]/[0-9][0-9]/[^\"]*ARTICLE_TOPIC[^\"]*\\.(jpg|jpeg|png)' | grep -v '\\-[0-9]' | sort | uniq
```

**Benefits of curl + grep:**
- Reliable for large CineD pages that exceed token limits (53k+ tokens)
- Fast execution and no browser overhead
- Precise pattern matching for specific image types
- No memory issues or browser instability
- Works consistently across different article sizes

**Method 3B: Playwright MCP (Recommended for Complex Parsing)**

Use Playwright when you need more sophisticated content extraction or when dealing with dynamic content:

**Method 3C: Markdown Export (Recommended for 2025+ Articles)**

This is the newest and most efficient method for processing CineD articles:

**Step 1: Export CineD Article to Markdown**
- Use browser extension or tool to export CineD article as markdown
- This bypasses token limits and provides clean, structured content
- Markdown includes all images, headers, and content structure

**Step 2: Extract Images from Markdown**
```bash
# Extract all image URLs from the exported markdown
grep -oE 'https://www\.cined\.com/content/uploads/[^)]*\.(jpg|jpeg|png)' article.md | sort | uniq
```

**Step 3: Process Content Structure**
- Use the markdown content directly for article structure
- Images are already properly referenced in the markdown
- Content sections are clearly defined with headers

**Benefits of Markdown Export Method:**
- **Fastest processing**: No browser automation needed
- **Complete content**: Gets full article text without token limits  
- **Perfect structure**: Maintains all headers, lists, and formatting
- **All images included**: No need to guess which images are relevant
- **Clean extraction**: No navigation menus or ads in content

**CRITICAL RULE: NO MADE-UP CONTENT**
- **USE ONLY ORIGINAL CONTENT**: Copy text directly from CineD markdown, do not add anything
- **NO EXPANSION**: Do not expand, enhance, or add additional context
- **NO FABRICATION**: Do not create new sections, examples, or explanations
- **PRESERVE AUTHENTICITY**: Maintain exact wording and structure from original
- **ATTRIBUTION INTEGRITY**: Only use content that actually exists in the source

**CRITICAL: EXTRACT ALL MEDIA FROM ORIGINAL**
- **INCLUDE ALL VIDEOS**: Extract and embed all iframe videos from original article
- **PRESERVE VIDEO CONTEXT**: Maintain exact placement and descriptions from original
- **YOUTUBE EMBEDS**: Convert YouTube links to proper iframe embeds
- **VIDEO CAPTIONS**: Include any video descriptions or captions from original
- **NO MISSING MEDIA**: Every image, video, and embed must be included

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# Process markdown export for lens aberrations article
def process_markdown_export(markdown_content):
    """Process exported markdown from CineD article"""
    
    # Extract image URLs from markdown
    image_urls = re.findall(r'https://www\.cined\.com/content/uploads/[^)]*\.(?:jpg|jpeg|png)', markdown_content)
    
    # Extract article sections based on headers
    sections = re.split(r'\n## ', markdown_content)
    
    # Process each image with descriptive filenames
    images_to_download = []
    for i, url in enumerate(image_urls):
        filename = f"article-topic-image-{i+1}.jpg"
        images_to_download.append({
            'url': url,
            'filename': filename,
            'alt': f'Description based on context',
            'caption': 'Caption based on context. Image source: CineD'
        })
    
    return images_to_download, sections
```

**When to Use Each Method:**

- **Method 3A (curl + grep)**: Quick image extraction, simple processing
- **Method 3B (Playwright MCP)**: Complex dynamic content, video extraction  
- **Method 3C (Markdown Export)**: Best for complete article processing, fastest overall

```python
# Navigate to CineD article
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url="https://www.cined.com/article-url/")

# Extract content using specific selectors
content = mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate(
    function="() => { return document.querySelector('.post-single-contents').innerHTML; }"
)

# Extract images using JavaScript
images = mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate(
    function="""() => {
        const images = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.post-single-contents img'));
        return images.map(img => ({
            src: img.src,
            alt: img.alt || '',
            caption: img.nextElementSibling?.textContent || ''
        }));
    }"""
)

# Extract video embeds
videos = mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate(
    function="""() => {
        const iframes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.post-single-contents iframe'));
        return iframes.map(iframe => ({
            src: iframe.src,
            title: iframe.title || '',
            type: iframe.src.includes('youtube') ? 'youtube' : 'other'
        }));
    }"""
)
```

**When to use Playwright:**
- Complex content extraction needs
- Dynamic content or JavaScript-heavy pages
- When you need precise content structure
- Video embed extraction
- Complete content parsing beyond just images

**When to use curl + grep:**
- Simple image URL extraction
- Large pages that may exceed token limits
- Batch processing multiple articles
- When you only need specific file patterns

#### Step 4: Video Content Extraction

For articles containing video content, use additional patterns:

```bash
# Extract YouTube video IDs
curl -s "CINED_URL" | grep -oE 'youtube\.com/embed/[^"?]*' | sed 's/.*embed\///'

# Extract Vimeo video IDs  
curl -s "CINED_URL" | grep -oE 'player\.vimeo\.com/video/[0-9]+' | sed 's/.*video\///'

# Extract other iframe embeds
curl -s "CINED_URL" | grep -oE '<iframe[^>]*src="[^"]*"[^>]*>' | grep -oE 'src="[^"]*"'
```

#### Step 5: Create Complete Processing Script for New Articles

Create a Python script for generating complete Jekyll posts from scratch:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
New Article Creation Script for CineD Content
Input: CineD URL
Output: Complete Jekyll blog post with images and content
"""
import requests
import re
from pathlib import Path
import time
from datetime import datetime

def extract_article_info(cined_url):
    """Extract article title, topic, and date from CineD URL"""
    # Extract topic from URL
    topic = cined_url.split('/')[-2] if cined_url.endswith('/') else cined_url.split('/')[-1]
    
    # Generate filename-friendly version
    filename_topic = topic.replace('-', '-')
    
    # Current date for Jekyll post
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    
    return {
        'topic': topic,
        'filename_topic': filename_topic,
        'date': current_date,
        'cined_url': cined_url
    }

def extract_images_and_videos(cined_url, topic):
    """Extract images and videos from CineD article"""
    
    # Method A: curl + grep for images
    images_cmd = f'curl -s "{cined_url}" | grep -oE \'https://www\\.cined\\.com/content/uploads/202[0-9]/[0-9][0-9]/[^"]*{topic}[^"]*\\.(jpg|jpeg|png)\' | grep -v \'\\-[0-9]\' | sort | uniq'
    
    # Method B: Playwright for complex content (use when needed)
    # See Playwright examples in Method 3B above
    
    # Extract videos
    videos_cmd = f'curl -s "{cined_url}" | grep -oE \'youtube\\.com/embed/[^"?]*\' | sed \'s/.*embed\///\''
    
    return {
        'images_extraction_cmd': images_cmd,
        'videos_extraction_cmd': videos_cmd
    }

def create_jekyll_post(article_info, images, videos, content):
    """Create complete Jekyll post file"""
    
    filename = f"{article_info['date']}-{article_info['filename_topic']}.markdown"
    filepath = f"/Users/mac/repos/mzdev/_posts/{filename}"
    
    # Generate front matter
    front_matter = f"""---
date: '{article_info['date']}'
image: /assets/images/posts/{article_info['filename_topic']}-hero.jpg
layout: post
meta_description: Professional filmmaking insights about {article_info['topic'].replace('-', ' ')}
subtitle: Professional filmmaking insights about {article_info['topic'].replace('-', ' ')}
title: {article_info['topic'].replace('-', ' ').title()}
---"""

    # Generate complete content with images and videos
    full_content = generate_comprehensive_content(article_info['topic'], images, videos)
    
    # Write file
    with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(front_matter + '\n\n' + full_content)
    
    return filepath

def generate_comprehensive_content(topic, images, videos):
    """Generate expert-level educational content (3000-8000 words)"""
    # This would contain the full article generation logic
    # Similar to the comprehensive content created in the 50 completed articles
    pass
```

### Approach B: Processing Existing Placeholder Posts (Legacy)

This was the workflow used for the completed 50-article project where placeholder posts already existed.

#### Step B1: Identify Posts to Process
```bash
grep -l "Read the full article at CineD" _posts/*.markdown
```

#### Step B2: Read Current Post and Extract CineD URL

#### Step B3: Use Same Media Extraction Methods
Use the curl + grep or Playwright methods described in Step 3 above.

### Step 6: Verify Image URLs
Test a few image URLs to ensure they're accessible:
```bash
curl -I "https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/.../image.jpg"
```

### Step 5: Create Processing Script
Create a Python script following this template structure:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import re
from pathlib import Path

def download_images_and_create_markdown():
    """Download images from the [ARTICLE_TOPIC] article and create clean markdown content"""
    
    # Images extracted from CineD article content - relevant to [TOPIC]
    images_to_download = [
        {
            'url': 'https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/YYYY/MM/image-name.jpg',
            'filename': 'article-topic-descriptive-name.jpg',
            'alt': 'Descriptive alt text for accessibility',
            'caption': 'Image source credit'
        },
        # ... more images
    ]
    
    # Video embeds if present
    videos = [
        {
            'type': 'youtube',
            'embed_id': 'VIDEO_ID',
            'title': 'Video title',
            'caption': 'Video description/caption'
        }
    ]

                })
                response.raise_for_status()
                
                with open(image_path, 'wb') as f:
                    f.write(response.content)
                print(f"  Successfully downloaded: {img_info['filename']}")
            else:
                print(f"  Already exists: {img_info['filename']}")

                'alt': img_info['alt'],
                'caption': img_info.get('caption', '')
            })
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"  Error downloading {img_info['url']}: {e}")

    """
    
    return markdown_content

def update_post():
    """Update the [ARTICLE_TOPIC] post with clean content and images"""
    
    # Download images and create markdown
    full_content = download_images_and_create_markdown()

    else:
        print(f"Could not parse front matter in {post_file.name}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    update_post()
```

### Step 6: Execute Processing Script
```bash
python process_[article_topic]_article.py
```

### Step 7: Verify Results
- Check that all images downloaded successfully
- Verify the article content is complete and well-formatted
- Ensure the "Read the full article at CineD" link has been removed
- Confirm images display properly in the post

## Content Guidelines

### Image Selection
- Extract 6-12 relevant images from the CineD article
- Use descriptive, SEO-friendly filenames following kebab-case
- Include proper alt text for accessibility
- Credit all images with "Image source: CineD"
- Place images contextually within the article content
- Ensure images support and enhance the written content

### Video Integration
- Extract video embeds as iframe elements
- Include descriptive captions for each video
- Ensure videos are contextually relevant to the surrounding content
- Test video embeds to ensure they work properly

### Content Quality
- Create comprehensive, expert-level content covering the article topic
- Include practical insights, technical details, and professional examples
- Use the original CineD preview as inspiration but expand significantly
- Remove any CineD-specific references or promotional content
- Ensure proper markdown formatting with clear heading hierarchy
- Include contextual placement of images throughout the article
- Aim for 3000-8000 words for comprehensive coverage

### File Naming Conventions
- **Images**: `article-topic-descriptive-name.jpg`
- **Scripts**: `process_[article_topic]_article.py`
- Use kebab-case (hyphens) for consistency

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Before Processing
- [ ] Confirm the CineD URL is accessible
- [ ] Check that the article has substantial content (not just a brief preview)
- [ ] Verify the post file structure matches expected format

### During Processing
- [ ] Playwright successfully navigates to CineD URL
- [ ] Content extraction uses `.post-single-contents` selector
- [ ] All relevant images are identified and have working URLs
- [ ] Video embeds are properly detected and formatted
- [ ] Script downloads images without errors

### After Processing
- [ ] Verify all images downloaded successfully
- [ ] Check that markdown formatting is correct
- [ ] Ensure images display properly in the article
- [ ] Confirm video embeds work correctly
- [ ] Validate that CineD reference has been removed
- [ ] Test that the article reads naturally and completely

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Image Download Failures**
- Check image URLs for 404 errors
- Verify image file extensions match actual content
- Ensure proper User-Agent headers in requests

**Content Quality Issues**
- If content includes UI elements, navigation, or forms, the selector may be wrong
- Use `.post-single-contents` selector specifically for clean content
- Avoid requests/BeautifulSoup approach - stick with Playwright MCP

**Video Embed Issues**
- Ensure video IDs are extracted correctly
- Test video embeds in markdown preview
- Check for start time parameters in YouTube URLs

**Markdown Formatting**
- Maintain consistent image caption formatting
- Use proper heading hierarchy (##, ###, etc.)
- Ensure proper spacing around images and videos

### Best Practices

1. **Use Playwright MCP**: Superior content quality compared to other scraping methods
2. **Test Image Downloads**: Always verify images downloaded successfully before proceeding
3. **Contextual Placement**: Place images and videos contextually within the content
4. **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions for files and scripts
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have fewer high-quality images than many irrelevant ones

## Success Metrics

## File Locations

- **Articles**: `/Users/mac/repos/mzdev/_posts/`
- **Images**: `/Users/mac/repos/mzdev/assets/images/posts/`
- **Scripts**: `/Users/mac/repos/mzdev/process_*_article.py`
- **Documentation**: `/Users/mac/repos/mzdev/CINED_ARTICLE_PROCESSING_WORKFLOW.md`

## Future Use Cases

### Creating New Articles from CineD URLs

For future processing, articles will be **created from scratch** using just a CineD URL. This workflow supports:

1. **Direct Article Creation**: Generate complete Jekyll posts from CineD URLs
2. **Comprehensive Content Development**: Full articles with images, videos, and expert analysis
3. **Professional Quality**: Educational resources matching the high standards achieved in this project
4. **Scalable Process**: Efficient workflow for processing new content as it becomes available

### Workflow for New Article Creation

**Input**: CineD article URL  
**Output**: Complete Jekyll blog post with images, content, and proper formatting

**Steps**:
1. **Article Analysis**: Review CineD URL for topic, scope, and available media
2. **Content Planning**: Develop comprehensive outline based on article topic
3. **Media Extraction**: Use proven curl+grep or Playwright techniques for images/videos
4. **Content Generation**: Create expert-level educational content (3000-8000 words)
5. **Jekyll Integration**: Generate proper front matter and file structure
6. **Quality Assurance**: Verify all media downloads and content quality

## Python Scripts Management

**Current Status**: 63 processing scripts created (one per article plus some duplicates)

**Recommendation**: 
- **Keep one template script** for future use: `process_article_template.py` (now updated for new workflow)
- **Archive or delete** the 63 specific scripts as they were single-use
- **Maintain this workflow document** as the primary reference

The individual scripts served their purpose and are no longer needed since all articles have been processed. The template script has been updated to support the new workflow for creating articles from scratch.

## Complete Workflow Summary for Future Use

### Quick Reference: Creating New Articles from CineD URLs

**Input Required**: CineD article URL only

**Process**:
1. **Extract article info** from URL (topic, title, date)
2. **Use curl + grep** to extract image URLs: 
   ```bash
   curl -s "CINED_URL" | grep -oE 'https://www\.cined\.com/content/uploads/202[0-9]/[0-9][0-9]/[^"]*TOPIC[^"]*\.(jpg|jpeg|png)' | grep -v '\-[0-9]' | sort | uniq
   ```
3. **Use curl + grep** to extract video IDs:
   ```bash
   curl -s "CINED_URL" | grep -oE 'youtube\.com/embed/[^"?]*' | sed 's/.*embed\///'
   ```
4. **Update template script** with extracted URLs and topic information
5. **Generate comprehensive content** (3000-8000 words) covering the topic
6. **Execute script** to create complete Jekyll post with front matter
7. **Verify** all images downloaded and content is properly formatted

**Output**: Complete Jekyll blog post ready for publication

### Alternative: Playwright for Complex Extraction

When curl + grep is insufficient (dynamic content, complex parsing needs):

```python
# Navigate and extract with Playwright
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url="CINED_URL")
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot()

# Extract images
images = mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate(
    function="""() => {
        const images = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.post-single-contents img'));
        return images.map(img => ({ src: img.src, alt: img.alt || '' }));
    }"""
)

# Extract videos  
videos = mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate(
    function="""() => {
        const iframes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.post-single-contents iframe'));
        return iframes.filter(iframe => iframe.src.includes('youtube')).map(iframe => ({
            src: iframe.src,
            embed_id: iframe.src.split('/embed/')[1]?.split('?')[0]
        }));
    }"""
)
