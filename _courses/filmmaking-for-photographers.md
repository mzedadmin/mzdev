  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Setup and Audio
    Lesson Description: "In this first episode, Philip shows you what you will need
      to turn your stills camera into a filmmaking machine and get the most out of
      it. Then we look at the first major difference between stills and film (and
      something that is equally important as the image!), the addition of sound. \n\nPhilip
      gives us an in-depth look at the various types of microphones and recorders,
      and demystifies polar patterns to help you get the best sound possible in any
      type of location. We finish by looking at the art of foley."
  - Lesson Title: Working with Light
    Lesson Description: |-
      In this episode Philip explores light and the different approach you require for filmmaking. We'll look at filming exteriors, how we're affected by factors like the time of day or year, the weather, the location, and how the movement of that great keylight in the sky, the sun, affects our choices.

      Then we continue to look at interiors and explore how to craft the scene and mood of an environment to becomes a character of its own in your film. We'll look at common lighting styles both photographic and cinematic, how to practice with them and see how they're used to communicate beyond just what we see. Finally Philip guides us through lighting people, and the particular challenge when we introduce movement.
  - Lesson Title: Movement
    Lesson Description: |-
      The biggest difference between photography and film is movement. It's not just how we move but why. In this lesson Philip explains the reasoning behind movement in filmmaking. We will look at the different styles of movement, from basic handheld to gimbals, as well as movement within the frame.

      We'll then look at how lens choice mixed with angle and composition affects what we see on camera and our sense of movement. We will also look at different framing choices and how the 180-degree rule informs the entering and leaving of the frame. Finally we will follow Philip as he plans to block out a large one-shot moving sequence.
  - Lesson Title: Sequences
    Lesson Description: "In photography everything depends on that single image, however
      in film no single image stands on its own. In filmmaking everything we see on
      screen is a sequence, and understanding how we construct them is essential to
      filmmaking. \n\nIn this episode Philip explores how to plan out sequential stories.
      We discuss how the unique art and psychology of filmmaking can be seen, mastered
      and broken including the all-important 180-degree rule. Learn how editing starts
      before we even begin filming and follow Philip to see his process as he creates
      various sequences."
  - Lesson Title: Story and Narrative
    Lesson Description: "It's stories that make us watch films, without them our attention
      span is very limited. As a species we communicate through stories and have passed
      down our history and lessons for millenia. In this modern age where we have
      so much content around us the story is even more important, as a good story
      will make your work stand out in a sea of noise. \n\nIn the past four episodes
      we have looked at all the key elements that differentiate photography from filmmaking.
      In this episode Philip puts it all into practice in real world situations, showing
      how he ties all the previous lessons together to make both a promotional video
      for private accommodation and then a commercial piece for a restaurant."
  - Lesson Title: Post Production
    Lesson Description: One of the biggest differences between photography and video
      is the amount of time you spend in post production. Editing video can be very
      time-intensive, even for experienced filmmakers. In this episode Philip takes
      us through key post steps such such as preparing and organising your footage,
      pacing and timing in editing, and working with audio, music and color, as well
      as general tips and tricks to get the best possible results.
