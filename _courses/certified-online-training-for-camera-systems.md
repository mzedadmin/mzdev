  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: ALEXA LF and ALEXA SXT W
    Lesson Description: In this lesson we are introduced to the ARRI ALEXA LF and the ALEXA SXT W cameras, before taking an in-depth look at their features, layout and capabilities to assist you in becoming a confident camera operator on set.
  - Lesson Title: AMIRA and ALEXA Mini
    Lesson Description: We continue the course by looking at the ARRI AMIRA and the ALEXA Mini cameras. We review the cameras' features, layout and capabilities to assist you in becoming a confident camera operator on set.
  - Lesson Title: Lens Mounts, Lenses and Filters
    Lesson Description: In this module we look at the native lens mounts of the ALEXA LF, ALEXA SXT W, ALEXA Mini and AMIRA, and how they can be adapted to support a wide range of lens choices. We then discuss the image and illumination circle of lenses to identify how different lenses cover different sensor sizes, before looking at framelines and both traditional and behind-the-lens filtration.
  - Lesson Title: Menu Configuration, Web Remote and Camera Accessories
    Lesson Description: Here we take a look at the various ways to configure and remotely control the ALEXA LF, ALEXA SXT W, ALEXA Mini and AMIRA.
  - Lesson Title: Recording Media, Recording Formats, and Online Tools
    Lesson Description: In this module we look at the different types of media supported by the camera systems, as well as the various formats in terms of sensor modes, aspect ratios, lens styles and codecs that are available.
  - Lesson Title: ARRIRAW, Rec709 v LogC, Exposure and Focus Control
    Lesson Description: To best understand ARRIRAW we start with a detailed explanation of how a camera sensor converts optical light into a digital signal inside the camera. Following that we look at how color is processed and the various tools available to assist with exposure and focusing.
  - Lesson Title: ARRI Looks, Color Tool and Post Production Workflows
    Lesson Description: ARRI offers a wide range of workflows for managing color including in-camera, off-camera, during post production and even live-grading on set. In this module we look at each of those options and the various software tools available to assist you in realising your creative vision through the production and post pipeline.
  - Lesson Title: ARRI Image Quality and HDR
    Lesson Description: We begin the final module in the course by discussing image quality and the roles of resolution, dynamic range and color reproduction from a camera sensor. Then we investigate High Dynamic Range (HDR) video and how the ARRI cameras are already equipped to take full advantage of these new formats.
