  - Text: Wow. Fantastic course. The subtext portion is WORTH the price of the course
      alone.
    Reviewer: Terrell E.
  - Text: Absolutely worth every second of your attention. Alex approaches filmmaking
      alongside you in a very real practical way. If youâ€™ve watched his first lesson
      series this is a perfect and more up to date partner to that. Seriously hope
      MZed will have him teaching on again soon!!!
    Reviewer: German D.
  - Text: An absolutely mind-blowing wealth on creative and technical knowledge, skills,
      techniques, and new forms of trying and exploring the craft of story-telling,
      more specifically, lighting and cinematography. Having attended his first tour
      of workshops, that was amazing, but this second tour, Visual Storytelling 2,
      was so packed with info that was informative and inspiring - to perfect and
      improve the art and skills I'm working on. I was so impressed with Alex and
      his articulate and down to earth advice and direction. I highly recommend this
      course, and cannot wait to review it again.

      the previous module, in a firelight scene live demo that replicates a shot from
      "The Maze Runner".

      to shooting a car spot, using the Lincoln Matthew McConaughey TVC and SNL's
      Jim Carrey parody as an example. He then shows us some techniques that even
      Hollywood feature films use to shoot car scenes without requiring huge budgets.
  - Lesson Title: Day Exteriors
    Lesson Description: Alex tackles one of the most difficult shots to shoot on a
      budget - the day exterior. Using the SNL sketch "New Day" as a case study he
      walks us through a complete breakdown of how he lit and shot it all in just

      Flynton". He goes on to share his insights on how best to get hired for jobs.
  - Lesson Title: Understanding Visual Subtext
    Lesson Description: The inflation of images in the modern world has caused a recession
      of meaning - we've been overexposed to the point where a picture is no longer
      "worth 1,000 words". This has made visual subtext all the more important as
      filmmakers and artists look to add more depth to their creations. In this module
      Alex gives his three rules to visual subtext, explaining how to add subtext
      to your film to make it more universal through case studies including "The Silence
      of the Lambs", "Guardians of the Galaxy", "Gladiator" and more.
  - Lesson Title: Getting started with Visual Subtext
    Lesson Description: In the final module of the course Alex looks at how to begin
      introducing visual subtext to your own works. He reviews the primary sources
      for subtext and gives examples of each, before concluding with an explanation
      of how he attempted to incorporate these techniques into his work on "Green
      Street Hooligans".
