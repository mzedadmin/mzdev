  - Text: Was great to learn from cinematographer Ian McCausland again. Attended on-hands
      instruction which he gave at AbelCine in Burbank, California a few years ago
      on Arri and Sony professional cameras. As one can sense through this online
      class, Ian exhibits great professional skill and enthusiasm in his personalized
      teaching.

      to apply them. It even got some coloring tips.
