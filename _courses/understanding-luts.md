  - Text: Was great to learn from cinematographer Ian McCausland again. Attended on-hands
      instruction which he gave at AbelCine in Burbank, California a few years ago
      on Arri and Sony professional cameras. As one can sense through this online
      class, Ian exhibits great professional skill and enthusiasm in his personalized
      teaching.
