  - Text: Very good introduction to lighting, specifically the emotion you can achieve
      with different techniques. On the subject of color theory, as Ollie touched
      on, a great book to pick up is Patti Bellantoni's "If It's Purple, Someone's
      Gonna Die", which goes into depth about color in films and the emotion on the
      audience.

  - Text: Great compact course, I especially appreciated how Ollie selected non-complex
      example scenes and included one where he used one light to make a good corporate
      talking head scene with careful use of practicals. His lecture just screams
      competence as he is able to compress complex topics into simple explanation
      without trivialization. Also I've never heard the color/how human eye works
      theory in such interesting context. Cheers for making this lecture

  - Lesson Title: 3 Pillars of Lighting Design
    Lesson Description: At the beginning of the course, Ollie defines the term "Lighting
      Design" and shares his approach, which is built on three main pillars - Depth,
      Composition, and Emotion. Explaining how viewers interpret visual cues, he demonstrates
      general techniques for creating depth, and introduces the concepts of Chiaroscuro
      lighting and the Rembrandt triangle.

  - Lesson Title: Interview Lighting
    Lesson Description: The second module is a practical live demonstration of how
      to approach lighting in a simple interview setup. Ollie breaks down the process
      of setting the key light step by step, showcasing an aesthetically pleasing
      approach. He also shares tips on shaping the nose shadow and creating a catchlight
      in the eyes.
  - Lesson Title: Creating Depth
    Lesson Description: Here, Ollie demonstrates lighting design in various scenarios,
      ranging from podcasts to concept photography, and shares his tricks for creating
      depth in challenging situations, such as filming multiple people with multiple
      cameras. He also introduces the concept of backlighting and dives into the ability
      of our eyes to recognize shapes and patterns, showing how this understanding
      can be applied to designing light effectively.
  - Lesson Title: Backlighting
    Lesson Description: This module is dedicated to the backlighting process and the
      art of creating layers. You will encounter terms like "kicker" and "ambient
      light" and learn various techniques to make your subjects stand out, tailored
      to the specific effect you want to achieve.
  - Lesson Title: Compositional Aspect
    Lesson Description: At this point, we already know how to set the key, fill, and
      backlight, so it's time to explore some tweaks and tips. Ollie poses the question
      - What can I do with my lighting to enhance the image composition? He then shares
      insights and techniques to help draw the viewer's attention to specific areas
      or elements in the shot, grounded in scientific research on human vision.
  - Lesson Title: Emotional Impact of Lighting
    Lesson Description: In the final module, Ollie dives into the emotional aspect
      of lighting and demonstrates how deliberate (and sometimes very subtle) lighting
      decisions can alter our perception of a scene and enhance storytelling. Using
      examples from his own work as well as from major films and series, he illustrates
      these concepts in action. This module also touches on the topic of colors and
      skin tones, exploring how lighting interacts with them.
