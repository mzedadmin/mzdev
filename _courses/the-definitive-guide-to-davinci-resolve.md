  - Text: Awesome! I have been using Davinci Resolve for a year now but did only rough
      editing and using LUTs. This course gave me a deep insight into this incredible
      powerful tool. Thank you Ollie.

  - Text: 'Ollie is the perfect instructor: calm, logical, and great at moving through
      the entire application''s workflow on a step by step basis. An absolutely fabulous
      course for anyone looking to learn the essentials of how to operate DaVinci
      Resolve.'
    Reviewer: Jonny G.
  - Text: Phenomenal + thorough. Ollie pays attention to detail and his delivery is
      clear. At no time does he assume that the viewer already knows something so
      he takes the time to explain everything he mentions. It's a lot of information
      which will have you being more equipped as a beginner. Looking forward to the
      rest of the Resolve courses.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: 'Quickstart: Editing a One Minute Movie'
    Lesson Description: Before we start to deep dive into DaVinci Resolve, in this
      introductory module Ollie uses the project of a one-minute short movie to get
      you comfortable with many of the concepts that will be taught throughout the
      course.
  - Lesson Title: Organizing a New Project
    Lesson Description: Having taken a quick overview of creating a movie in DaVinci
      Resolve in the opening module, Ollie starts to explain the software in much
      more depth. In this lesson we look at creating and setting up a project, before
      going through the Media Pool and how to import, manage and sort clips to help
      with workflow.
  - Lesson Title: Assembling a Rough Cut
    Lesson Description: Moving on to the Edit page, Ollie shows us how to assemble
      a timeline, scrub through clips and create basic edits to assemble a rough cut.
  - Lesson Title: Moving Clips in the Timeline
    Lesson Description: Building on the fundamentals of the prior lesson, here we
      explore how easily DaVinci Resolve allows us to make more powerful edits.
  - Lesson Title: Refining a Timeline
    Lesson Description: In this lesson Ollie introduces us to various trimming techniques
      in DaVinci Resolve to help us refine the project edit.
  - Lesson Title: Applying Transitions and Effects
    Lesson Description: Now that you're familiar with editing in DaVinci Resolve,
      Ollie introduces us to transitions including fades, dissolves and more advanced
      filter effects.
  - Lesson Title: Working with Audio on the Edit Page
    Lesson Description: While DaVinci Resolve features a completely integrated Digital
      Audio Workstation (DAW) with Fairlight, it's also important to be able to manage
      basic audio parameters from within the Edit page, which is what Ollie walks
      us through in this lesson.
  - Lesson Title: Mixing Sound in Fairlight
    Lesson Description: Unlike most other NLE programs, DaVinci Resolve features a
      complete DAW inside the application with Fairlight, meaning you never have to
      leave Resolve to access incredibly powerful audio mixing and processing techniques.
      In this module Ollie steps through the Fairlight interface as well as fundamental
      operations and advanced techniques to help you get fantastic audio on any project.
  - Lesson Title: Creating Graphics and Effects in Fusion
    Lesson Description: In addition to a fully fledged audio workstation with Fairlight,
      DaVinci Resolve also includes a complete motion graphics, VFX and compositing
      application in the Fusion page. Here Ollie introduces us to working with Fusion,
      and shows us how to perform basic composites, motion titles and a complete green
      screen key with tracking.
  - Lesson Title: 'Quickstart: Color Correction'
    Lesson Description: Moving on to the Color page, in this lesson Ollie introduces
      us to the very basics of color correction in DaVinci Resolve.
  - Lesson Title: Performing Primary Color Corrections
    Lesson Description: Now that we have a basic understanding of the Color page within
      Resolve, Ollie dives a little deeper to show how to make primary corrections
      to the sample project.
  - Lesson Title: Making Secondary Adjustments
    Lesson Description: Following the primary adjustments of the previous lesson it's
      now time to look at secondary corrections. Here Ollie looks at Resolve's powerful
      targeting tools including qualifiers and power windows to help target areas
      within the frame.
  - Lesson Title: Designing Creative Looks
    Lesson Description: In the final color module of the course Ollie reviews how
      to create creative looks in DaVinci Resolve, including working with LUTs.
  - Lesson Title: Delivering a Final Program
    Lesson Description: Now that we have the skills necessary to create amazing projects
      in DaVinci Resolve we move to the Delivery page where Ollie shows us how to
      export and queue projects for web, broadcast and more.
  - Lesson Title: Managing Media and Databases
    Lesson Description: In the final lesson in the course Ollie covers management
      of the DaVinci Resolve database and how to backup and administer your installation
      and media files.
  - Lesson Title: Bonus Module - Davinci Resolve 16 (beta)
    Lesson Description: While Resolve 16 doesn't change any of the elements of the
      course, in this bonus module Ollie breaks down the new features of Resolve 16's
      public beta including the new "Cut" page.
