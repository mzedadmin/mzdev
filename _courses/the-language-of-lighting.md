  Main Title: The Language of Lighting
  Main Text: "Lighting is a language communicating information and emotions to the
    viewer. It is also a language visual artists use to communicate with each other.
    This course is not just about lamps and lighting conventions. Learn to see light
    like a professional cinematographer and design it to tell a story. \n\nWhat is
    the purpose of lighting in a scene and how to connect it with your character?
    What is the difference between lighting on set or on a soundstage? How do you
    lead a team of lighting technicians? What is the best lighting unit to choose,
    and why? All these questions and more are answered in this course, filmed on a
    soundstage and utilizing demonstrations and many scenes from great films."

  Reviews:
  - Text: I feel like an electrician now. I didn't know what a gray card did or what
      shutter speed, aperture, or ISO was, until now. Waveforms, histograms, and coloring
      images is easily explained. He shows some really cool movie examples to show
      unique types of lighting and really good history lessons on lenses. A very great
      knowledgy course.
    Reviewer: Mark A.
  - Text: The teacher is prepared and professional. He combines explanations with
      practical examples. Recommended for those who want to understand how a certain
      lighting tells a story.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Seeing light like a cinematographer
    Lesson Description: "What are the most basic objectives of lighting, and how to
      even describe light so that others can see the same thing? \n\nBasic concepts
      of lighting, such as emulation, are introduced and demonstrated."
  - Lesson Title: Believable Lighting
    Lesson Description: "Lighting needs to convince the audience that it's real, even
      when it's not. In the process of creating that believability, lighting designers
      build the fictional world. \n\nLighting also tells stories and creates effects
      - all this and more in this video."
  - Lesson Title: Lighting for Story
    Lesson Description: How is lighting used to deliver information to the audience?
      Concepts such as contrast and movement are introduced, and we go through the
      entire process of designing lighting for a scene, from script to screen, in
      this video.
  - Lesson Title: Practical Lighting
    Lesson Description: "When is it a good idea to use practicals vs. movie lights?
      A deeper dive into the characteristics of light reveals the answer. \n\nAdvanced
      topics such as the inverse square law, diffusion and color temperature are reviewed."
  - Lesson Title: Filming on location
    Lesson Description: "Independent films often film on location. How does this affect
      lighting? What is the difference between a location and a soundstage? \n\nFactors
      of equipment, crew and time are reviewed, as well as a deep dive into electricity."
  - Lesson Title: Lighting and running a set
    Lesson Description: Blocking and lighting are closely related but seldom discussed
      together. We close the loop and introduce procedures to successfully run a set
      with lighting, as well as look at multi-camera specifically.
  - Lesson Title: Measuring light
    Lesson Description: "Tools to plan for lighting without even having a camera or
      lights are introduced. \n\nThe light meter, waveform monitor and histogram are
      introduced."
  - Lesson Title: Lighting in color
    Lesson Description: "How does the camera see color, and how does that affect lighting
      design? \n\nLooking deeper at color temperature, color gels, vectorscope and
      color meters reveals a hidden world."
  - Lesson Title: Lighting Tools and Safety
    Lesson Description: "What types of lamps are there and how are they different?
      From tungsten to HMI, fluorescent and LED, we look at each type and create a
      foundation for picking the right lighting unit for a task. \n\nWe finish with
      reviewing safety procedures needed to work on location."
