      The ability to easily change the lens mount between EF, PL,

  - Lesson Title: Rigs & Cages
    Lesson Description: |-
      With its compact form-factor and digital image stabilization,
      the C500 Mark II can be operated as an extremely discreet handheld package.
      But by building it out with accessories you can easily transform it into a fully-fledged
      studio camera or a proper shoulder-mounted camera. In this module Jem gives
      an overview of some of the possibilities to help you get the most from your
      camera in different on set scenarios.
  - Lesson Title: Camera Setup
    Lesson Description: Now that we’re familiar with the camera hardware, it’s time
      to dive into the menus and configuration to best understand how to setup the
      camera for the needs of each job. To get it started, Jem takes us through the
      exposure setup, including options with iris and ISO, ND filters, color temperatures,

      production scenarios. But it doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Should you shoot
      in BT709, Canon Log2, and in what color matrix? What are the HLG or PQ options?

      to monitors.

      Aspect Ratio Markers, and more.

      has been the user assignable buttons. The C500 Mark II can have up to 22 assignable
      buttons when using the EU-V2 expansion module, so there’s a lot of room for
