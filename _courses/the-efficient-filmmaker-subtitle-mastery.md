  Lessons:

      it. But rejecting it altogether means missing out on a world of powerful, time-saving

    Lesson Description: In this lesson, we focus on creating subtitles in Avid Media
      Composer. We'll use ScriptSync AI to generate a clean, structured transcript

      learn quick workarounds to split long text blocks into properly formatted, single-line
      subtitles.

      efficient workflow for doing this in Adobe Premiere Pro.
