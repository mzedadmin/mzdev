  - Text: What a wonderful master class. It is eye-opening and really focuses on the
      importance of building a strong foundation for film making. Each module has
      the precise information needed and that I was hoping to gain from Philip's perspective.
      The motivation and confidence I gained from learning the critical skills in
      this masterclass will surely help me with my future projects.

  - Text: Thank you Philip Bloom! I wish I could show you the pages of notes I wrote
      while going through the course. I feel empowered and more confident to go out
      and try some new techniques. This course has definitely increased my knowledge
      of filmmaking. Now to go out and put it into practice!

  - Text: This is a wonderful course for both beginners and professionals. I have
      been in the industry for about 8 years as an editor and cameraman and I find
      myself always learning every day and I have learned loads while taking Philip's
      Cinematic Master Class. My girlfriend is completely new to filmmaking and she
      was able to follow along as well. The information may be technical but Philip
      you really do a great job at breaking down all of the information in a way that
      is easy to understand for all levels. Thank you for a great Masterclass!
