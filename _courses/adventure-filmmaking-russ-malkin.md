  - Lesson Title: From Idea to Reality
    Lesson Description: Ideas can come from anywhere, sometimes even on the back of
      a boarding pass. In this lesson Russ talks about how to develop an idea and
      turn it into a real adventure.
  - Lesson Title: The Research
    Lesson Description: The devil is in the details, and in this lesson Russ describes
      everything that goes into the research stage of your adventure. From team dynamics
      and scheduling, to route planning, permits, lodging, safety, and how to update
      family and fans along the trip.
  - Lesson Title: The Team
    Lesson Description: In this lesson Russ lays out the roles on your adventure film,
      from director, producer, camera crew, production assistant, DIT, and executive
      producer, to how to find and select your team, keeping an eye on team dynamics,
      and even joining another adventure team first to give you a sense of the roles
      that fit your personality.
  - Lesson Title: The Budget
    Lesson Description: Before you can find the money to fund your adventure film,
      you need to create a budget. In this lesson Russ talks about preliminary expenses
      during your adventure planning, insurance and safety, and how to develop a worst
      case budget to prepare for any scenario.
  - Lesson Title: How to Find the Money
    Lesson Description: Now we get to the defining part of your adventure filmmaking
      planning - finding the money to pay for it. In this lesson Russ provides an
      overview to pitching your adventure, working with commissioning editors, distribution
      companies, sponsors, tourism authorities, and philanthropists and grants, as
      well as some personal advice to persistance in the face of funding challenges.
  - Lesson Title: The Talent
    Lesson Description: Who will be the storyteller on your adventure film? You may
      plan on presenting yourself, or using voice over, but Russ also has some advice
      on working with celebrities and other talent who bring interest and audience
      to your project.
  - Lesson Title: Logistics and Planning
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, Russ guides you through the logistics planning
      of your adventure, from choosing your route and creating a schedule, to ensuring
      safety training, immunizations, and passports are all checked off before you
      go. The key is to prepare for logistical hiccups so they don't become major
      setbacks during the trip.
  - Lesson Title: Camera Equipment
    Lesson Description: When you're filming an adventure, Russ advises to stay small,
      quick, and nimble. From the camera choices, audio recording, to bonus shots
      using gimbals or drones, on an adventure it's important to be prepared for equipment
      failure when you least expect it.
  - Lesson Title: Last Checks
    Lesson Description: It's almost time to set off on your adventure, but first you
      want to make sure you have everything in place. Do you have PR photos for your
      sponsors, or a plan to take them during your trip? Are your friends and family
      prepared for you to be gone for a while? Do you have all of your notes organized?
      Finally, you're off on your adventure!
