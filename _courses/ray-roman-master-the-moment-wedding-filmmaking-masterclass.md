  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Getting Started
    Lesson Description: As we start the masterclass Ray describes how he transitioned
      from police detective to become the world's most sought-after wedding filmmaker,
      shaping the industry along the way.
  - Lesson Title: The Basics
    Lesson Description: Before we can get to our wedding location it's important to
      understand the fundamentals that are essential to document a wedding to the
      standard of Ray Roman Films. In this lesson Ray takes you through the basics
      you need to know as well as the gear that he trusts to get the job done every
      time.
  - Lesson Title: Bride and Groom Preps
    Lesson Description: The pre-ceremony offers you the most opportunity for creative
      freedom, so it's paramount that you make the most of this time with the couple.
      Here Ray walks you through an entire bride and groom prep session, showing you
      how to get best results while keeping your couple relaxed and natural.
  - Lesson Title: First Look and Candids
    Lesson Description: Continuing the Pre-Ceremony, we move on to the first look
      and candids which is typically a time where you'll have total creative control.
      This is your opportunity to capture moments and create stunning visuals that
      will be key elements in your film, and in this lesson Ray gives you his formula
      for success.
  - Lesson Title: The Ceremony
    Lesson Description: The ceremony is, without doubt, the most important element
      of the day and one that requires meticulous preparation and execution from the
      entire team. In this module Ray and his team walk you through the entire ceremony
      from guest arrival to recessional, showing you the exact formula that they use
      for 99% of traditional events.
  - Lesson Title: The Reception
    Lesson Description: While being less formal than the ceremony, the reception is
      packed with events that you'll need to capture and showcase in your film. We
      join Ray at Daisy Hill once again as he takes you step-by-step through exactly
      how he documents each element of the reception, including a bulletproof approach
      to capturing the all-important speeches, and an interview with one of the US's
      top event DJs to get an understanding of how wedding filmmakers can best collaborate
      for outstanding audio capture.
  - Lesson Title: Post-Production
    Lesson Description: Back in the studio Ray breaks down his approach to edits,
      before talking through the Daisy Hill trailer edit, and deconstructing some
      of his most popular and beloved wedding trailers.
  - Lesson Title: Destination and Non-Traditional Weddings
    Lesson Description: If you want to expand your business into the high-end arena
      you'll need to understand how to adapt Ray's blueprint to fit varying cultural
      weddings. In this module Ray covers Jewish, Indian and Same-Sex weddings, before
      discussing his approach to documenting a destination wedding.
  - Lesson Title: Business Development and Marketing
    Lesson Description: While Ray's signature stunning visuals, cinematic edits and
      celebrity clientele have captured the hearts of couples all over the globe,
      it's his branding and business approach that has elevated him to the very top
      of the industry. In this lesson Ray shares how he operates at the most lucrative
      end of the market, and offers his most hard-earned tips for streamlining your
      business for success. He then interviews two luxury wedding planners to discover
      what you need to do to get on their radar and start attracting high-end wedding
      clients.
