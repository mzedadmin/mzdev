  - Text: UNBELIEVABLY USEFUL!! Just a great crash course on everything about Film
      Producing. Great interviews, well structured, and easy to understand. There
      is not a lot of available education on Producing and this is an invaluable recourse!!
    Reviewer: Dylan K.

      perspectives on the different topics.

    Lesson Description: You'll get the 40,000-foot view of producing from this module.
      From the definition of a producer to the role of the producer, from what it

      covers it all.
  - Lesson Title: Pre-Production (The Pitch, Fundraising, Budget...)
    Lesson Description: Pre-production is where things start to feel real. Master
      the elements and your life, not to mention the crew's, will be so much easier.
  - Lesson Title: Legal
    Lesson Description: Becoming a lawyer not what you had in mind? No worries. You
      don't need to be one to become a successful producer. You do need to know the
      right questions to ask. In this module, Graham shares what those are.
  - Lesson Title: Producer-Shooter
    Lesson Description: Documentary filming is well-known for using a producer-shooter.

  - Lesson Title: Post Production
    Lesson Description: Post is where the ultimate vision comes into place. Learn
      how to anticipate issues and keep your cool.
  - Lesson Title: Distribution
    Lesson Description: How to get the film you've worked on for months, maybe even
      years, seen. Graham shares the key points of distribution, a part of the industry
      sometimes overlooked or misunderstood by filmmakers.
  - Lesson Title: Bonus Interview
    Lesson Description: Graham interviews Clark Peterson who is the producer of the
      Academy Award-winning film Monster starring Charlize Theron. He has produced
      and executive produced a wide variety of award-winning films, documentaries,
