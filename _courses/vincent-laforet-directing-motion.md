  Main Title: Vincent Laforet's Directing Motion
  Main Text: "One of the most important skills modern directors and DPs are required
    to master is moving the camera in a dynamic and engaging fashion. Commercial Director
    and Pulitzer-Prize winning Photographer Vincent Laforet teaches filmmakers of
    all levels the precise cinematic language of motion, and how to move not only
    the camera itself, but also the components in your scene in order to bring a richer
    viewing experience while enhancing the story. \n\nThis course will give you a
    solid foundation in camera movement, blocking, lensing, and sequencing, and show
    you how to direct any crew precisely and effectively to execute your vision."

  - Text: Back in 2011 I went to a professional film school and ended up with a Diploma
      in Motion Directing and Cinematography. If you cant afford expensive film school
      but want the no-nonsense, no-"BS" learning package, Vincent Laforet's course
      is probably the closest you can get. A huge knowledge treasure you can get for
      a fraction of what you would pay in a regular School. I invested in a one year
      membership subscription with the goal to refresh and maybe to learn new stuff.
      I haven't been disapointed. This is the real deal!

  - Text: This course is TOP NOTCH and a must for directors and cinematographers.
      Especially for those with small crews or doing a project solo, it goes over
      the roles and thinking and how to map a project & subsequent shots out regardless
      if you have a production team or if you alone ARE the production team. Follow
      Vincent's formulaic and time-proven coverage principles and you will be well
      on your way to a successful shoot.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: The Language of Camera Motion
    Lesson Description: |-
      At the beginning of the course Vincent provides an introduction
      to Directing Motion, and gives a brief history of the evolution of cinematic
      motion. He instructs you to move from a passive consumer of film to an active
      student, outlining the tools you need to understand how to energise the frame
      and further immerse your audience, starting with the language of camera motion
      and how to describe basic and complex camera moves in both 2D and 3D space.
  - Lesson Title: Live Demo - Introduction to Motion
    Lesson Description: |-
      In this module Vincent takes us through multiple live demos,
      showing how camera motion can be executed to add depth to your film. From simple
      moves like a slide to reveal to complex coordinated movements like a zoom-dolly
      or "Zolly", Vincent shows how to execute these moves perfectly on both Hollywood
      level production equipment as well as a more accessible alternative.
  - Lesson Title: How, When and Why to Move the Camera
    Lesson Description: |-
      We continue our study of camera motion as Vincent guides us
      through more complex moves, again using classic examples from Hollywood's greatest
      films. We look at using camera motion to satisfy coverage principles, touch
      on actor blocking and movement within the frame, and discuss motivated versus
      unmotivated movement and when it is acceptable and appropriate to use the latter.
  - Lesson Title: Live Demo - Universal Rules of Coverage
    Lesson Description: |-
      In the second live shoot of the course Vincent takes us through
      a pair of scenes from Spielberg's masterpiece, Shindler's List. We start by
      looking at the principles of coverage, and how to shoot a scene to make it more
      engaging before looking at a clear definition of roles on a film set. Vincent
      not only clearly demonstrates how to recreate the shots in the film, but also
      gives an intimate lesson on how to approach directing actors in both pre-production
      and on set.
  - Lesson Title: Constructing Scenes to Engage
    Lesson Description: |-
      In this module we continue to examine complex and combined
      camera movements, with the emphasis on sequencing to create an effective and
      engaging scene. Using examples from a range of classic films such as "The Shawshank
      Redemption" and "Goodfellas", Vincent gives his keys to providing a rich frame,
      as well as his coverage principles. We look at the concept of a moving master
      shot, and when to not move the camera, before finishing with a director's script
      breakdown.
  - Lesson Title: Live Demo - Dynamic TV-Style Action Scene
    Lesson Description: |-
      For the final live shoot of the course Vincent guides us through
      a sample episodic-style multi-camera shoot firstly using a Steadicam stabilizer,
      then to shoulder-mounted before ending with a gimbal-mounted shot.
  - Lesson Title: One Shot Wonders
    Lesson Description: |-
      One Shot "Wonders" are the bravest of scenes in filmmaking.
      In this module Vincent takes us through some of Hollywood's greatest and most
      memorable one-shot sequences where multiple scenes are linked in a single take,
      using intricately choreographed cinematography and camera motion. He deconstructs
      them and explains exactly how camera and actors are used to make every frame
      dynamic and energised, to heighten the audience's enjoyment of the piece.
  - Lesson Title: Post Production of Live Demos
    Lesson Description: |-
      In this short module, the Directing Motion post-production
      specialist takes us through the editing of the three live shoots from the course,
      including quick shortcuts for creating a multi-camera sequence in Adobe Premiere
      Pro.
  - Lesson Title: Case Study - Nike TVC
    Lesson Description: |-
      In the final module of the course Vincent takes us through
      his process for a high-end corporate commercial based on his work on the Nike
      Flyknit TVC. He explains his steps from conception through the proposal and
      bid, budgeting, storyboarding and all the way through execution, sharing his
      tips for success and hard-won lessons.
