  - Text: A great masterclass, especially the part about the four characteristics of a good cinematographer. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the work of different members of the camera department. Thank you for the wonderful insights!

  - Text: VERY GREAT, VERY INSPIRING...Gave me the exact information that I was searching for as I'm on my way up to be a professional cinematographer and building up my cinematography career with all technical skills, lighting skills, character of the cinematographer, etc...its everything I needed!

  - Text: This course was one of the main reasons I signed up for a membership. It really delivered, and Julio was entertaining and shows some great tips and tricks any DP can use. I wish ARRI would make a few more workshops like this where we have a cinematographer break down their process and show rehearsals and walk us through their production methods in a practical down to earth way. Julio does a great job of instructing you as if you were his apprentice, and less like a college student learning theory from a PhD. It was very practical and I enjoyed it very much, highly recommend.
