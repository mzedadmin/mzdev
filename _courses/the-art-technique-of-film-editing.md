  - Text: Finished this course and it might be one of the single most valuable things
      in terms of editing that I have seen. I went to film school and got the basics
      of editing and theory but this course helped to elevate everything I learned
      there so much. Very inspiring course and one that I plan on watching through
      again soon.
    Reviewer: Jacob F.
  - Text: I've been editing films and TV for four years, and this course has taught
      me so much, I highly recommend it for not only editors but directors, cinematographers,
      producers, and everyone loves to get a deep understanding of the real film industry.
    Reviewer: Almuthana K.
  - Text: Tom is an excellent teacher, all of the content is outstanding and the insights
      you will gain on the art and craft of film editing are well worth the price
      of admission... a relatively rare opportunity to get this level of access to
      such a talented editor who shares their wisdom on the craft of film editing
      in articulate depth and practical detail.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Introduction
    Lesson Description: In the first lesson of the course, Tom takes us back to his
      early days working in New York City as a commercial, documentary, and TV assistant
      editor. Wanting to get his hands on the brand new AVID non-linear editing system,
      Tom worked wherever he could, learning from other masters for years before he
      transitioned to the editor role. Later in his career, he demonstrates how relationships
      are the key to the filmmaking business, when he called on his AVID reps to loan
      him an editing suite for a small budget movie he was working on, "Whiplash",
      which would ultimately win Tom an Academy Award in Editing.
  - Lesson Title: Setting Up Your Cutting Room
    Lesson Description: Every editor develops a preference for the editing room setup,
      but in this lesson we also learn when an editor might change the layout to suit
      the needs of the director and producer. Choosing a room with a window or one
      that is completely dark, how to arrange your speakers, creating a wall calendar
      for the movie development, to organizing the scenes in a "wall of cards" - these
      are all considerations for any feature film editor. Tom also describes his infamous
      "Do Not Disturb" red light that prevents unwanted disruptions when reviewing
      the latest edits.
  - Lesson Title: Requesting Your Technical Specifications
    Lesson Description: It is up to the editor to define precisely how you want your
      footage. You have the power to ask for what you need, says Tom. That includes
      the specific codec you're working in, burned in timecode for the sound editor,
      the aspect ratio and resolution, the media naming convention, and especially
      the Frame and Focus Leader. If you don't ask, the studio might default to the
      last film they worked on, with completely different technical specifications.
  - Lesson Title: Script, Camera, and Sound Reports
    Lesson Description: It's the editor's responsibility to get as much information
      as possible about the footage you receive. In this lesson, Tom discusses the
      typical notes he'll receive during a feature film shoot, including director's
      comments, updates from the script supervisor, and notes from the camera and
      sound department.
  - Lesson Title: Wall Cards
    Lesson Description: What are wall cards and why are they essential for organizing
      a movie structure as it's being filmed? Tom clues us into the typical conventions
      and also how he personally uses wall cards.
  - Lesson Title: Know Your Footage
    Lesson Description: One of the most important jobs of an editor is to know the
      footage. That means watching every frame that's been shot, organizing dailies,
      and creating an inventory of everything. Tom guides us through his process,
      including the highly time consuming but essential job of script syncing all
      the footage.
  - Lesson Title: Editorial Crew
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, Tom describes the different roles of an editorial
      crew and how they collaborate on an edit. He also provides advice to assistant
      editors who want to learn on the job. Lastly, we learn about relying on subject
      experts when a film needs to be accurate, and when it's possible to push aside
      realism to improve the cinematic and dramatic story.
  - Lesson Title: Reels
    Lesson Description: To illustrate the function of film reels, Tom compares an
      editor to a train dispatcher sending multiple trains out concurrently. On a
      film, the editor has to task multiple assignments to other departments, such
      as sound mixing and visual effects. Separating the movie into smaller portions
      - or reels - has a practical history with film, but it continues to serve a
      vital role in editing today.
  - Lesson Title: AVID
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, Tom shares his thoughts on non-linear editing
      systems, including Adobe Premiere, Apple Final Cut, and AVID Media Composer.
      He emphasizes that while all programs are capable and useful, there's a few
      reasons why feature films are typically edited in AVID.
  - Lesson Title: The Editor and Director Relationship
    Lesson Description: Since the 1950s, movies have been considered a director's
      medium, and the editor is hired to execute that vision. But in Tom's experience,
      each director has a completely different perspective on the editor relationship.
      He describes his process with director Damien Chazelle and how they have developed
      a trust for one another after collaborating on films such as "La La Land" ,
      "Whiplash", and "First Man".
  - Lesson Title: Rough Cuts
    Lesson Description: Who sees the initial rough cuts? Tom clues us into the intimate,
      trusted relationship between an editor and director, and the etiquette for showing
      dailies and rough cuts to a film's producers and studio representatives.
  - Lesson Title: Asking The Right Questions
    Lesson Description: Before you can tackle an editing project of any size or complexity,
      you must first answer a series of questions. What is the movie about? What is
      the theme and tone? The answers will inform the editing style and whether you're
      editing for character, story, or theme.
  - Lesson Title: Editing Style
    Lesson Description: The style of an edit includes many variables, including rhythm,
      pace, timing, shot selection, and inserts. In his perspective, Tom says sometimes
      you want the edit to be invisible, and other times you want viewers to notice
      the editing. He illustrates edit style with a look at "JFK", which mixes in
      archival footage in a unique way.
  - Lesson Title: Tom's Biggest Influences
    Lesson Description: In this illustrative lesson, Tom guides us through his favourite
      scenes in a number of classic films, including "Heat", "The French Connection",
      "Raging Bull", "Lawrence of Arabia" and more. We learn about rhythm, parallel
      cutting, and contrast, as well as editing for impact.
  - Lesson Title: Conveying Information
    Lesson Description: Through the example of the New York City Subway, Tom describes
      the appropriate time and place for conveying information in a movie, in order
      to guide viewers rather than overwhelm them.
  - Lesson Title: A Lesson from Tim Squyres
    Lesson Description: In this module, Tom shares an editing style he's learned from
      Tim Squyres, editor for director Ang Lee (Life of Pi, Crouching Tiger, Hidden
      Dragon).
  - Lesson Title: Choosing Selects
    Lesson Description: As an editor, you may not have the luxury of watching all
      the footage more than once, so you have to make it count. Tom reveals his own
      process for selecting favorite shots and placing them in initial sequences.
  - Lesson Title: The Rough Cut
    Lesson Description: Using the script as a guide book, Tom takes us through his
      approach to the first assembly. With notes from the director and script supervisor,
      along with your own intuition and process, there are multiple ways to tackle
      the first pass through of a film edit.
  - Lesson Title: Character and Point of View
    Lesson Description: The face, and particularly the eyes, are the window to a character.
      Using examples from Hitchcock, Tom gives us an insight into his approach to
      a scene with multiple characters, and how we use the gaze to determine a scene's
      geography and character focus.
  - Lesson Title: Is There a Wrong Way to Edit?
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, Tom discusses the importance of serving the
      story and characters, rather than imposing your own ego and style to an edit.
  - Lesson Title: Storyboards
    Lesson Description: To what extent should you follow the storyboards or animatics
      provided to you as an editor? Tom presents a few different perspectives on storyboards,
      and why for his films he prefers to cut based on the actors' performances rather
      than following a strict storyboard.
  - Lesson Title: Opticals
    Lesson Description: Blow ups, reframes, repositions, speed changes, morphs, flops
      - these are all types of opticals, which are simple effects used by editors
      to help the story. You can get away with a lot of image alterations, but they
      have to be done purposeful.
  - Lesson Title: Morphs
    Lesson Description: In order to speed up an actor's performance, you may have
      to use a morph effect, where you blend together images of the actor's face as
      seamlessly as possible. While it's an essential tool, the morph effect has to
      be used with precision to ensure the audience doesn't notice it.
  - Lesson Title: Insert Shots
    Lesson Description: Some editors believe editing should be invisible, but using
      the example of "Whiplash", Tom reveals how director Damien Chazelle wanted the
      edit to become its own character in the film. By capturing a variety of inserts
      - or close up details of objects - Chazelle ensured that he had enough little
      pieces to create a rhythm in the edit.
  - Lesson Title: Screenings and Feedback
    Lesson Description: Who gets to see your rough cuts? Do you seek feedback? How
      much do the opinions of friends, family, and even your editorial crew inform
      or change your own beliefs on the film direction? In this lesson, Tom discusses
      the important considerations when you open your rough cuts to screenings.
  - Lesson Title: Introduction to Hostiles
    Lesson Description: As he walks us through the beginning to the movie "Hostiles",
      Tom clues us into his editing decisions with selling stunts, how to use sound
      prelaps for transitions, and how to purposefully disorient viewers before bringing
      all the pieces together. Most importantly, he emphasizes his philosophy on favoring
      faces - especially if they're familiar movie star faces like Christian Bale.
  - Lesson Title: A Guide to Whiplash, the Short Film
    Lesson Description: In this sweeping lesson, Tom takes us through the short film
      version of "Whiplash". Using the language of editing, we see how the viewer
      experiences extreme discomfort and dizzying fear in only a few short minutes.
      We see how inserts and closeups, editing rhythm and contrasting pace, and the
      use of the character's gaze all work in tandem to put us inside the world of
      a jazz drummer.
  - Lesson Title: Whiplash, the Feature Film
    Lesson Description: Get a behind-the-scenes look into the film that earned Tom
      Cross an Academy Award in Editing, as well as nominations for Best Picture and
      Best Adapted Screenplay. Now that you've seen the making of the short film,
      in this lesson Tom shows us how he and director Damien Chazelle had to revise
      their approach when they edited the feature-length version.
  - Lesson Title: Setting the Tone in Whiplash
    Lesson Description: With the classic Martin Scorcese film "Raging Bull" as a guide,
      Tom shows us how he borrowed editing styles from action and sports films to
      set the tone for "Whiplash".
  - Lesson Title: Contrasting Styles in Whiplash
    Lesson Description: To accentuate the different sequences in "Whiplash", Tom recounts
      how he chose to contrast the pace, rhythm and speed from scene to scene.
  - Lesson Title: Dinner Scene in Whiplash
    Lesson Description: Using the dinner scene from "Whiplash" as an example, Tom
      shows us how to setup classical geography around a table, build up tension with
      the pace of the cuts, and push character development within one scene.
  - Lesson Title: Whiplash Ending
    Lesson Description: The last scene should be the best scene in the movie, says
      Tom Cross, describing his shared philosophy with director Damien Chazelle. In
      this lesson, Tom recalls all of the initial attempts at ending "Whiplash", before
      focusing on the essential and most dramatic elements. Through the process of
      syncing music and drum shots with the emotional character performances, we see
      how Tom built up the film's closing scene in a way that resembles the blood
      bath in "The Wild Bunch".
  - Lesson Title: La La Land Opening Sequence
    Lesson Description: Originally, the opening of "La La Land" had an old fashioned
      overture with screen credits before the first musical dance number. But when
      it didn't seem to work, Tom illustrates how thinking outside the box with a
      visual effect enabled the film to blend a single shot sequence with an introduction
      to our main characters on the Los Angeles freeway.
  - Lesson Title: La La Land Roommate Dance
    Lesson Description: A one-shot sequence doesn't leave much room for editing, but
      Tom shows us how this musical scene was greatly improved with hidden cuts, morphs
      and speed changes to sync with the music, and a composited background from different
      takes.
  - Lesson Title: La La Land Montage
    Lesson Description: To signify the passing of time and an emotional shift in Emma
      Stone's character, we see the clever use of dissolves and collages in a montage
      love letter to Hollywood.
  - Lesson Title: A Walk through Hollywood in La La Land
    Lesson Description: A short lesson in sound design, Tom shows us how Emma Stone's
      simple night time walk through Hollywood is enhanced with ambient and footstep
      sounds.
  - Lesson Title: Introducing the Main Characters in La La Land
    Lesson Description: Through the grammar of cinematic language, the audience is
      introduced to Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling with parallel sequences. The similarities
      in shot rhythm allows viewers to feel the similarities between the two characters.
  - Lesson Title: Morphs in La La Land
    Lesson Description: Morph edits play an important role in "La La Land", enabling
      Tom to remove line flubs and errors in what appears to be unbroken shots.
  - Lesson Title: Timing in La La Land
    Lesson Description: With the musical nature of "La La Land" the rhythm and pacing
      of shots and sequences play an important part in the story's flow. Tom also
      describes how background music takes on a different level of detail with director
      Damien Chazelle, who is a musician and has a strong belief in the significance
      of musical timing.
  - Lesson Title: Contrast in La La Land
    Lesson Description: While walking us through a scene in "La La Land", Tom illustrates
      the use of contrasting style and pace when flowing from one scene to another.
      This particular scene, where Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling perform a live piano
      duet in a single take, also depends on careful timing and morph effects. Finally
      we learn why the scene utilizes a heavy green cast, as a reference to Hitchcok's
      "Vertigo".
  - Lesson Title: Checker Boarding Character Storylines
    Lesson Description: In a reference to the montage in "Citizen Kane", which signifies
      the passing of time and a change in relationship, Tom walks us through the parallel
      scenes that show Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's characters growing apart. When
      they arrive at the scene of John Legend's performance, the rapid cuts and eye
      glances build up a crescendo resulting in a decisive ending.
  - Lesson Title: First Man Opening Sequence
    Lesson Description: According to "First Man" director Damien Chazelle, the last
      scene should be your best, but the first scene should be your second best. Tom
      walks us through the gripping opening sequence aboard an Apollo spacecraft,
      as we hear and see small details from the character's point of view that puts
      us into the center of the action.
  - Lesson Title: Juxtaposition and Rhythm in First Man
    Lesson Description: To create a contrast in the story of Niel Armstrong, Tom describes
      how he balanced the mission and space scenes with the earthbound Neil and his
      family. "The Moon and the Kitchen Sink" is how they referred to the two juxtaposed
      storylines in the film, and we see how a cinema veritÃ© camera style for the
      home scenes sets up a different style when we're aboard the space vessel.
  - Lesson Title: Documentary Style in First Man
    Lesson Description: Inspired by NASA archival footage and documentaries from the
      1960s-70s, many of the scenes in First Man were covered with multiple cameras,
      in a documentary, cinema veritÃ© style. To the cinematographer's surprise, Tom
      actually used many of the shooting imperfections which are the byproduct of
      this documentary style, such as rack focuses and snap zooms. The effect creates
      dramatic moments and transitions in scenes, giving them a flair of truth above
      the emotional effect.
  - Lesson Title: The Training Flight Crash in First Man
    Lesson Description: In this final lesson, Tom walks us through the chaotic scene
      in "First Man" where Niel Armstrong crashes during a lunar training flight.
      The scene is based on real footage of the crash, but director Damien Chazelle
      wanted to throw the audience headfirst into the action. We see how the use of
      inserts, sound fragments, and rapid cuts build up to the ultimate pay off -
      Niel Armstrong, played by actor Ryan Gosling, ejecting from the aircraft at
      the final moment before it explodes.
