    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I explain quickly the idea and ethos behind
      using transitions and the importance of asking yourself "why" you are using
      them. I truly believe that unless it adds something magical to your story or
      clarity to your message... a straight cut or fade will do the trick each time!
      Simpler can be better-er.
  - Lesson Title: Using the inbuilt transitions and what to look for
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I show you where to find Premiere Pros inbuilt
      transitions and how to add transitions to your media/edit points. I also implore

      why use it?
  - Lesson Title: Where can you find 3rd party transitions?
    Lesson Description: In this quick lesson, I share with you where I like to collect

      to be mined!
  - Lesson Title: The audio interface inside Premiere Pro
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I take you through the main sections of the
      audio interface within Premiere Pro. I talk through understanding the audio

      of quickly making something sound like it's far away, inside a room or coming
      from a car radio!
  - Lesson Title: Editing music tracks shorter or longer to any length of time
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I show you my tricks for taking any music
      track and strategically cutting it up to fit any length of time. This is really
      helpful if you have an edit you love, but can't find that perfect fitting track
      that hits all the right moments of the music vs picture. The good news is now
      you can!
  - Lesson Title: Adding sound effects to help with overall production value
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I show you through an existing edit that is
      good, but could be improved with the addition of sound effects. Here I use seven
      random sound effects and strategically place them throughout the edit and over
      certain cut points to enhance the pace and feel of the story. It works wonders
      and will for your projects too!
  - Lesson Title: Editing interviews and filling gaps in dialogue
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I take you through an audio edit of a dialogue
      track from an interview that has been cut up. I show you how to find or create
      a "room tone" to fill in those gaps. This technique ensures your newly edited
      interview and order of clips have a seamless, smooth sound.
  - Lesson Title: Sometimes less is more. Using silence to your advantage
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I take you through an edit that has had some
      sound design completed and how to challenge yourself to make it better by using
      less. By less I mean stripping back the audio SFX and sound design to attempt
      to enhance the overall story direction more. Watch and join along as we explore
      what's possible for the project and even I was surprised with the end product.
      Good or bad, I guess you can be the judge!

      problems, all whilst sharing hidden industry knowledge of common audio levels
      to aim for around dialogue, music and sound effects!
  - Lesson Title: Using Premiere Pro's Essential Sound Tool to help with audio
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I take you through finding the Essential Sound
      Tool, how to get started with it and what you can expect to gain from using
      it. A lot of people that I speak to have avoided using this purpose-built tool
      as they were unsure of how to get started... Well look no further, here's your
      chance to make audio editing, mixing and mastering that much easier.

    Lesson Description: In this lesson I take you through how to make an end logo
      frame alongside an effective "call to action". (Ps a call to action is just

      second has a small cost but, is alot faster with REV.com - a subtitling and
      captioning service that has saved my butt time and time again. Your videos will

      your video and edit into the famous 9:16 ratio and 1:1 ratio... Most commonly
      used for social "stories" in portrait mode, or the classic instagram square
      post! Premiere Pro has an "Auto Sequencing" option available which automates
      the process - however comes with some manual tweaking. The other solution is
      to follow some simple steps to complete it manually, which may feel more tasking
      but it comes with extra control over the final product.
  - Lesson Title: How to batch export your videos using Adobe Media Encoder
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, I show you how to make your life easier and
      more care free with Media Encoder. Whether it's one or one-hundred videos you
