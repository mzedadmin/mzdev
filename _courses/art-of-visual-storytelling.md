                        With the release of Sony’s FX6 Cinema Camera, the possibility of recording stunning, cinematic-quality 4K full-frame images with an affordable camcorder has become a reality. However, like any professional camera of this caliber, the FX6 is extremely complex and has a steep learning curve.

                    </p><p class="cs-text">And that’s why this Master Class has been created by Doug Jensen at Vortex Media to help FX6 owner/operators get started off on the right foot. This 8-hour training video series is the most thorough and efficient way to learn both the fundamentals and advanced features of Sony’s revolutionary new camcorder.

                                The Sony FX6 is a compact version of Sony's flagship cinema cameras, boasting a full-frame
                                10.2MP 4K sensor, 15+ stops dynamic range, and other advanced features. Despite lacking a

                                for content producers. Doug also compares shooting with HLG and S log three for optimal HDR
                                quality and future-proofing. This lesson provides instructions for setting up HLG shooting mode
                                and discusses the role of Gambit Display Assist (GDA) in improving LCD monitor visuals.

                                Doug highlights the need for post-production grading due to the maximum dynamic range captured
                                by the cine EI shooting mode. He also discusses the use of S-log3 for internal recording, the
                                application of Monitor LUTs, and the importance of exposure index. Tips on using zebras,

                                The FX6 is equipped with an SDI output for 10-bit 4:2:2 4K signal, embedded time code and audio.
                                For raw recording, a specific recorder is needed. The HDMI output supports 4K but only two audio
                                channels. Output formats depend on the camera's recording format and frequency. On-screen
                                displays and operational data can be superimposed by enabling output display menus. Remote
                                triggering of recording is possible with the SDI-HDMI record control menu. Test records and
                                simultaneous internal recording are recommended.

                                video. It's crucial for multi-camera shoots and long interviews. The timecode media tab allows
                                users to control display, duration, and modes. User bits can be programmed to identify shoot
                                date and camera ID. The lesson also explains jam syncing timecode, which involves designating a
                                master and slave camera and maintaining synchronization.

                                The FX6 boasts impressive slow motion capabilities, with the ability to shoot up to 120 frames
                                per second in 4K and 240 frames per second in HD. However, shooting HD slow motion at 240 frames
                                per second may result in decreased picture quality. The camera's S&Q motion feature allows for
                                shooting at various frame rates, producing high-quality clips ready for immediate playback.
                                Different memory cards are needed for different resolutions and frame rates. The setup for S&Q
                                motion is straightforward, with options to turn it on or off and select the frame rate. Using
                                frame rates above 60 fps in 4K automatically crops the sensor, and the shutter speed must match
                                or exceed the frame rate. For crisp slow motion, a shutter speed at least two times faster than
                                the frame rate is recommended. The shutter angle mode provides smoother transitions and
                                automatically adjusts the shutter speed.

                                Sony cameras offer a feature called interval recording or time-lapse shooting mode. The setup
                                involves adjusting settings in the project tab, including interval time and frames per capture.
                                The choice of settings depends on the subject and desired action. If a Sony LED video light is
                                attached, a lighting setting is available. The duration of a time-lapse depends on the settings,
                                and it's crucial to ensure it's long enough to be valuable. Time-lapse clips can be played back
                                immediately, and a slow shutter speed can create a smooth, blurred motion effect.
