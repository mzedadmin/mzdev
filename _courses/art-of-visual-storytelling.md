  - Text: One of the most comprehensive, practical, and fun filmmaking courses I've
      ever taken. Alex is engaging, generous, and clearly someone who enjoys sharing
      nuggets of information, advice, and wisdom. I will keep coming back to this
      course, as I work on telling my own stories through the magic of films. Highly
      recommend!

  - Text: I absolutely enjoyed Alex Buono's style, sense of humor and experiences
      he used to teach a crash course in Visual Storytelling. I particularly liked
      it when he gave the audience ways to create these images with DIY Gear without
      the expensive equipment that he self admittedly is so lucky to be able to use
      on SNL. He definitely shows his passion for his craft which rubs off on those
      who are watching to get better at ours.

  - Text: Excellent course, I really appreciated the higher level perspective and
      explanations of his choices. As someone who works in lower level crew positions
      I've worked with many setups like he demonstrated, but understanding the underlying
      reasoning for the choices is immensely valuable.
