  Main Title: Canon R5C Ultimate Video Manual
  Main Text: "In this ‘Ultimate Video Manual’ for the Canon EOS R5 C, professional
    filmmaker Ollie Kenchington drills down in to the video functionality of this
    exciting 8K hybrid camera. Since shooting Canon UK’s launch film for the R5 C
    in December 2021, Ollie has spent several years now using the camera on his productions.
    \n\nDrawing on these experiences, he has designed a course that quickly shed’s
    light on all the main functions for shooting video successfully with the R5 C.
    Moreover, in his characteristically detailed yet accessible style, Ollie even
    takes the time to explain higher level concepts around shutter angle, log gammas
    and exposure assistance tools, before ending the course with one of the most warts
    and all break downs of 180 VR we’ve ever seen!"

  Reviews:
  - Text: Great course, thoroughly enjoyed it. Ollie as usual was good, looking forward
      to the other courses he has done. My only wish would be that he does one that
      shows the editing workflow of the log process and colour grading.
    Reviewer: Patrick A.
  - Text: Excellent breakdown of the R5C's video features. Ollie's teaching style
      makes complex concepts easy to understand.
    Reviewer: Dennis M.
  - Text: Perfect for anyone looking to master the R5C for video work. The 180 VR
      section was particularly helpful.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Camera Setup
    Lesson Description: In this first module, after some basic menu navigation tips,
      Ollie moves through the Iris and Shutter options. We are shown the differences
      between Speed, Angle, Clear Scan and Slow, as well as examples of when each
      might be called upon.
  - Lesson Title: Dual Base ISO
    Lesson Description: Here, Ollie goes in to detail about how the R5 C's sensor
      handles noise, as well as the impact custom picture preset changes have on ISO
      levels and dynamic range handling. Ollie also touches on the importance of good
      quality ND filtration with third-party glass.
  - Lesson Title: Custom Picture Presets
    Lesson Description: After wrapping up the Camera Setup menu options, Ollie dives
      headlong in to the Custom Picture menu. Using his trusty Calibrite Video Checker
      chart, Ollie goes in to detail about the differences between BT.709 Standard,
      WideDR, CLog3 and how they affect your camera's ability to capture detail in
      highlights and shadows. He also briefly pulls back the curtain on the full extent
      of gamma, gamut and colour matrix customisation available to Canon cinema camera
      users.
  - Lesson Title: Assistance Functions
    Lesson Description: A complete run down of the in-built exposure guides and tools
      available are covered in this lesson. From False Color and Zebras, to Waveform
      monitors and Vectorscopes, Ollie is in his element here, as he brings his extensive
      image evaluation knowledge to bear on the R5 C.
  - Lesson Title: Recording & Media Setup
    Lesson Description: Ollie turns his attention to the myriad of recording options
      in the camera. From sensor crop modes to resolution, codec, bit rate, chroma
      subsampling and frame rate options, by the time you finish this lesson, you'll
      not only know what options are available in this camera, but why you would choose
      one over another. Ollie also touches on the importance of powering the camera
      and the relationship between this and your recording options.
  - Lesson Title: 2nd Card Rec. Functions
    Lesson Description: The R5 C takes both CFexpress and SD cards, allowing for multiple
      recording workflows. From proxy and sub recording, to relay and double slot
      recording, Ollie covers all bases in this chapter.
  - Lesson Title: Recording Mode
    Lesson Description: In this module, Ollie tackles the various recording modes
      available. Using examples from his own work, Ollie shows the Slow & Fast Motion
      modes, as well as the Frame and Interval recording modes.
  - Lesson Title: Auto Focus
    Lesson Description: Canon are renowned for pioneering stable and accurate auto
      focussing systems in their cinema cameras and the R5 C builds on that legacy
      with its powerful focussing feature set. As well as showing how to get the best
      from the camera's auto focus mode, Ollie also shows how to compliment manual
      focussing with assistive features like the Focus Guide and the 'Only Around
      Focus Point' mode.
  - Lesson Title: Digital I.S.
    Lesson Description: In this short lesson, Ollie guides us through the different
      levels of digital image stabilisation available in the R5 C, showing examples
      of each and when one might be preferred to another.
  - Lesson Title: Operator Tips
    Lesson Description: Given the small stature of the R5 C, it is the perfect camera
      for rigging up in a multitude of ways. In this lesson, Ollie takes us through
      some of the most common accessories you might choose to use when rigging this
      camera up, as well as offering his thoughts on power saving tips with Canon's
      LP-E6NH batteries.
  - Lesson Title: 180 VR
    Lesson Description: In Ollie's final module, he lifts the lid on creating 180
      degree virtual reality videos with the R5 C and Canon's Dual Fisheye Lens. From
      production tips for shooting the best immersive content possible, to post-production
      steps needed in Adobe Premiere Pro, Ollie shows the entire workflow from start
      to finish, using a test shot he captures in his local town.
