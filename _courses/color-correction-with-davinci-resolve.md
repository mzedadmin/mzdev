      informative since it was more advanced and in depth! Thanks for the great presentation!
    Reviewer: Dominic E.
  - Text: More in depth than other Resolve courses, it is the perfect course for upgrading
      colorist skills and a perfect companion for the other MZed Ollie's courses.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Balancing Footage
    Lesson Description: We begin the course by learning how to balance footage across
      multiple shots, which is applicable to all projects but particularly useful
      for documentary projects that often feature mixed lighting conditions, and scenes
      shot across multiple days and locations.
  - Lesson Title: Creating Color Continuity
    Lesson Description: The goal of shot matching is to assess how multiple clips
      compare to one another when placed into a timeline, and to ensure that they
      create color continuity so as to appear seamless to the viewer. Here, Ollie
      shows you how to match shots using Resolve's automatic tools, as well as a manual
      approach.
  - Lesson Title: Correcting and Enhancing Isolated Areas
    Lesson Description: Now that you understand the tools necessary for a primary
      grade, we begin to look at a second pass of refinement, or secondary grade.
      In this module we target specific areas of shots to enhance their effectiveness
      within the context of the project.
  - Lesson Title: Conforming from an XML Timeline
    Lesson Description: When importing projects from other NLEs you will frequently
      be working with XML based timelines, which will then need to be verified and
      conformed before grading can begin. In this lesson Ollie steps through the most
      common practices and issues associated with the conforming workflow, as well
      as more advanced project setup practices by setting up scene-referred color
      for optimal grading conditions.
  - Lesson Title: Mastering the Node Pipeline
    Lesson Description: The Node editor is a powerful component of the Color page
      that enables you to maintain precise control over the final appearance of images.
      With it, you may separate and target different stages of grading while ensuring
      an enhanced color output with minimum quality degradation. Here Ollie provides
      an in-depth overview of the Node pipeline in Resolve so that you fully understand
      how it operates and can effectively implement it in your projects.
  - Lesson Title: Managing Grades across Clips and Timelines
    Lesson Description: Grading a film or video project requires a considerable level
      of attention to detail and the use of a variety of tools throughout both primary
      and secondary stages. However, once a look is established, a project often makes
      repeated use of existing grades that propagate throughout the Timeline. In this
      lesson we look at a variety of workflows to allow you to reproduce and refine
      grades across multiple clips.
  - Lesson Title: Using Groups
    Lesson Description: Although generating and organizing groups is incredibly simple,
      they open up a new grading workflow within the Color page. In this lesson Ollie
      will show you how to apply group-wide grades via the Node editor, as well as
      numerous workflow tips and tricks to streamline grading using groups.
  - Lesson Title: Adjusting Image Properties
    Lesson Description: Though image colors tend to be a primary concern of the colorist,
      you can also make many transformative changes to footage to better accommodate
      the narrative and aesthetic output of a project. Here Ollie steps through a
      selection of image property adjustments including alterations to the scaling
      and positioning of the frame, noise reduction, and keyframing grades to change
      over time.
  - Lesson Title: Setting up RAW Projects
    Lesson Description: In this lesson Ollie breaks down advanced techniques for working
      with RAW video, maximising its wide dynamic range and uncompressed pixel data
      to provide the greatest possible grading potential for your projects.
  - Lesson Title: Delivering Projects
    Lesson Description: In the final module of the course we look at how to export
      your project in a variety of industry-standard formats, including a Digital
      Cinema Package (DCP) for cinema distribution.
