  - Text: The course is very well done, I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn
      how to build their own anamorphic lens set. The teacher is prepared and supports
      the explanations with demonstrations.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Finetuning for Big Improvements
    Lesson Description: In this episode, Tito goes into setting alignment for good,
      as well as discussing the keystone effect and how to fix it.
  - Lesson Title: Fast Lens Swaps
    Lesson Description: Let's look at anamorphic adapter jackets, DIY clamps, and
      prepare your spherical taking lenses for best performance on set.
  - Lesson Title: A Rig for Any Occasion
    Lesson Description: Rigging a camera for a day on set involves a lot of extra
      parts besides the camera itself. In this episode Tito talks about monitors,
      wireless video, and follow focus units - plus a quick build for a remote 1st
      AC station.
  - Lesson Title: A Rig for Any Occasion Continued
    Lesson Description: In the second part of this episode, Tito is switching all
      the NPF batteries for a good v-lock that feeds the entire rig. He's also looking
      at matteboxes, what they do, plus the good and bad things about them.
  - Lesson Title: Anamorphics on Gimbals
    Lesson Description: In this episode Tito introduces a few new ideas about using
      anamorphic adapters and lenses on budget gimbals. DJI's RS 3 Pro has changed
      his perspective on that, alongside the new wave of lightweight anamorphics
  - Lesson Title: Anamorphic Auto Focus
    Lesson Description: In this tutorial Tito walks you through setting up DJI's Range
      Finder to work without the gimbal so you can get autofocus on any lens you might
      wanna pair it up with!
  - Lesson Title: All The Small(Rig) Things
    Lesson Description: After all this rigging, there are still a handful of small
      bits and pieces Tito couldn't live without. These parts are the ones we tend
      to forget and that are so cheap it's impossible to justify not having them.
  - Lesson Title: Everything RIGHT with Anamorphic Adapters
    Lesson Description: This is a super cut from a series of conversations Tito had
      with folks who truly enjoy anamorphic adapters, and why they feel that way!
      A love letter to tinkering, and a masterclass with valuable tips and tricks.
