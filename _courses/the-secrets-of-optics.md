  Main Title: The Secrets of Optics
  Main Text: Ever been confused by focal length? Lens breathing? How about crop factors?
    What is the “Cooke Look” compared to that of Zeiss? In The Secrets of Optics you’ll
    learn the basics of lenses - what they do, how they do it, what types of lenses
    there are - so you have a solid foundation for selecting and operating lenses.

  - Text: Such a great introduction into the world of lenses, I believe this won't
      be the last time I watch this course as I continue learning and practicing.
      Thank you so much, Mitch.
    Reviewer: Claudia M.
  - Text: Awesome course and if you are starting with any course on MZed this is a
      great place. It gets the basics down solid and describes some deep, in-depth
      aspects to camera lenses that I never really realized.
    Reviewer: Josh B.
  - Text: Contains the information that I wasn't able to find online, at least not
      in ANY way close to how organized this was. Perfect, concise, but DETAILED,
      this is so useful for those types of people that like to understand concepts
      deeply by studying both it's evolution and intricacies.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: 'Introduction: What is a Lens?'
    Lesson Description: Before we get started explaining the ins and outs of lenses,
      Mitch takes the time to really define what a lens is and how modern lenses came
      about.
  - Lesson Title: Focal Lengths
    Lesson Description: In this module Mitch breaks down focal length, explaining
      the differences between a wide and telephoto lens and why there's no such thing
      as a "normal" lens.
  - Lesson Title: Crop Factor
    Lesson Description: Here Mitch takes us through how the camera sensor size affects
      our possible lens choice, and how different lenses behave on different sensor
      sizes.
  - Lesson Title: Lens Specs I
    Lesson Description: Ever been confused by the numerous specifications of lenses?
      In this module Mitch breaks down the most commonly used lens specs, explaining
      what they mean and showing examples on a wide range of lenses.
  - Lesson Title: Lens Specs II
    Lesson Description: Here we look at the lens specifications that manufacturers
      don't always give you. Things like focus breathing, zoom tracking, chromatic
      aberration, telecentricity and more are defined and discussed with examples.
  - Lesson Title: Lens Personality
    Lesson Description: In this module Mitch talks about the various aspects of lenses
      that give them personality, and why you might choose a certain lens for a certain
      look.
  - Lesson Title: Specialty Optics
    Lesson Description: For the final module in the course we look at specialty lenses
      and adaptors such as anamorphic and tilt-shift and discuss their application.
