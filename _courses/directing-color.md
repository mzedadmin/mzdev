  Main Title: Directing Color
  Main Text: "In Directing Color, filmmaker, editor and colorist Ollie Kenchington
    explores how visual language cues, color theory and even color grading techniques
    can be used throughout the filmmaking process to not just create a “look” but
    to enhance storytelling. \n\nHe challenges directors, cinematographers and filmmakers
    to think of color first rather than the more common approach of leaving color
    considerations until post-production."

  Reviews:
  - Text: '"Directing Color" course brings another point of view much more interesting
      and open-minded about color theory than other lessons I''ve taken before, and
      also great basic techniques that a filmmaker can start applying today. Ollie
      is a very good teacher, I am looking forward to see the next series of color
      while taking his DaVinci course (which I deeply recommend).'

  - Text: Ollie knows what he's talking about, so listen to him. This course opened
      my eyes to the color process being a part of production as much as post-production.
      Glad to put this info to use. Thanks Ollie!

      the amount of knowledge and insight has transformed my way of seeing light,
      color and storytelling.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Creating a Palette
    Lesson Description: In the first module of the course, Ollie introduces us to
      the concept of "Directing Color" as he begins to produce a commercial for a
      boutique catering company. He takes us through the process of how he developed
      a color palette for their brand which will be woven into the production design
      for the commercial, and explains how the relationships between colors can create
      compositional balance in your images.

  - Lesson Title: Perceiving Color
    Lesson Description: Here, Ollie gives us a quick primer on how the Human Visual
      System affects our perception of color and why that means certain colors recede
      and others advance in our perception.
  - Lesson Title: Calibrating Color
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, Ollie takes us through the process of building
      custom LUTs on set for monitoring. He shows how simple steps before rolling
      the camera can ensure everyone on set is connected with the image and able to
      see how the film's look is developing in every frame.
  - Lesson Title: Color Management
    Lesson Description: With everything now set to record, Ollie focuses on how simple
      colour and contrast management in production can maximise the quality of your
      digital negative. From using probes to ensure camera monitors are calibrated,
      to using charts to ensure white balance and contrast are consistent across all
      cameras; Ollie shows us his top tips for in-camera color management.
  - Lesson Title: Deconstructing Color I
    Lesson Description: With production wrapped on the commercial, Ollie brings us
      into the grading suite to discuss how contrast can be introduced in post-production
      to add depth. Ollie also shows us examples from 'The Crown' to reinforce this.
  - Lesson Title: Deconstructing Color II
    Lesson Description: As we continue looking at post-production, Ollie shows how
      hue and saturation can be used to direct the viewer's eye in the frame. Using
      examples from 'Blade Runner 2049', Ollie demonstrates how this technique can
      be used most effectively in your films.
  - Lesson Title: Deconstructing Color III
    Lesson Description: In the final lesson of the course Ollie delves into the most
      exciting part of color grading - conveying mood and eliciting emotion with color.
      He shows us how this is used so effectively in 'Whiplash', where color becomes
      a signifier to the emotional journey of the film's protagonist.
  - Lesson Title: Bonus Module - "Ox & Origin"
    Lesson Description: This bonus module allows you to see the finished product of
      the "Ox & Origin" commercial from the course.
