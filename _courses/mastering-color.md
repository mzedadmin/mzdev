  - Text: Brilliant course. Very practical, engaging and humorous at the same time.
      Suitable for beginners and professionals looking to branch out alike.

  - Text: Exceptional course. I enjoyed learning from Ollie, he has a great way of
      communicating complex and technical information into easily digestible concepts.
      I'm by no means a 'colour master' now but I have a much better understanding
      of the grading process and how it relates to shooting content. I'm looking forward
      to watching his other classes!

  - Text: Ollie is a fantastic instructor and I feel that my understanding of color
      is significantly improved after this course. I'm already noticing a greater
      appreciation and understanding of color choices in the films I am watching.
      Highly recommended.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Grading Suite Setup
    Lesson Description: In the first module, Ollie shows us why setting up an environment
      where your eyes and monitors can be trusted is of vital importance. As well
      as seeing how professional suites are configured, thanks to a rare interview
      with CHEAT lead colorist, Toby Tomkins, Ollie also gives practical tips on how
      to create a home suite on a budget and how to calibrate your own monitors. He
      finishes up with advice on working with clients in the room, and how to decode
      emotive keywords that clients might use to describe the look they are after.
  - Lesson Title: Contrast
    Lesson Description: Here, Ollie breaks down the differences between contrast,
      tonality, dynamic range and luminance perception. He also teaches us the fundamentals
      of reading histograms and waveform monitors, to help avoid clipping and crushing
      when using lift, gamma, gain controls. To help illustrate these topics, Ollie
      uses a broadcast commercial for a sofa company, where contrast is used to make
      the product stand out against its surroundings.
  - Lesson Title: Color Balancing
    Lesson Description: In this lesson, Ollie discusses the basic concepts of the
      additive color model and how we can use this knowledge to counteract color casts
      in our images. Along the way, we learn how to use the Parade, Vectorscope, RGB
      Overlay Waveform Monitor and RGB picker. We also hear from acclaimed cinematographer
      Brett Danton, as he discusses how important accurate colors are to him and his
      clients.
  - Lesson Title: Continuity
    Lesson Description: Continuity is the unsung hero in color grading, and an often
      overlooked part of the process. In this lesson, Ollie takes on the challenge
      of matching Canon and Sony cameras on a multicam shoot, using an X-Rite Color
      Checker Video chart. He then breaks down his workflow for creating visual harmony
      across a sequence of shots in a short film (The Storm, created by Vimeo Staff
      Pick winning director, Sam Buchanan), while discussing stills, image wipes and
      split screens along the way.
  - Lesson Title: Skin Tones
    Lesson Description: With the fundamentals of primary grading dealt with, Ollie
      now turns his attention to one of the most important parts of color grading
      - skin tones. What are memory colors? Is there such a thing as the perfect skin
      tone? How do we make faces look realistic, yet cinematic at the same time? All
      these questions are answered by Ollie in this module, with valuable contributions
      made along the way by Academy award winning make up artist, Peter Swords King.
  - Lesson Title: Creative Looks
    Lesson Description: Ollie starts here with a discussion about the differences
      between technical and creative LUTs. Ollie talks about the importance of owning
      your own images and gives tips on how to develop your own looks using curves
      and qualifiers, the differences between monochrome and desaturated looks and
      how to use split screens and versions in DaVinci Resolve to audition looks quickly.
  - Lesson Title: Film Emulation
    Lesson Description: In this module, Ollie tackles the two distinct areas of the
      look of film - texture and colour. What can you do with stock effects? What
      can be achieved with dedicated tools, like FilmConvert? Ollie uses the latest
      music video from acclaimed celluloid DP, Jamie Harding, to show how he matches
      footage from the Arri Alexa and Arri SR2. He also gives a demonstration of how
      he addresses film halation, using simple techniques in DaVinci Resolve.
  - Lesson Title: HDR & Raw
    Lesson Description: In Ollieʼs final module, he teams up with internationally
      renowned filmmaker, Philip Bloom, to look at the future of film production and
      delivery - HDR. Starting off in Philipʼs hometown of Richmond, the pair shoot
      ProRes RAW and Canon Raw Light during golden hour, while discussing the dos
      and donʼts of recording for HDR delivery. Ollie then heads back to the grading
      suite to show Philip what his work looks like on a 1000 nit HDR monitor, and
      how to set up, grade and deliver HDR video. Ollie also talks about raw workflow
      and how working in raw can benefit your clients, even if you are only delivering
      in HD SDR.
