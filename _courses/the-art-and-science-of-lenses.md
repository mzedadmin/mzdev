  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Light and Lenses
    Lesson Description: Understanding lenses begins with understanding light. Learn what light is and how it
      behaves particles, waves, interference, the inverse square law and more. This
      foundation is necessary to truly understand why lenses behave the way they do and why
      lens manufacturers make certain decisions. It will allow you to understand the problems
      manufacturers try to solve when creating lenses and come up with creative storytelling
      ideas using the behavior of light.
  - Lesson Title: When Light Meets an Object
    Lesson Description: Light can be absorbed, reflected, transmitted, scattered and refracted. Usually it does
      all of it, to some degree, at the same time. Gain an in-depth understanding of each of
      these phenomena so that you can better predict the way lenses behave and operate. Learn
      basic optical equations which are used when designing lenses and gain a new view on the
      ways light behaves around us every day.
  - Lesson Title: Basic Optical Devices
    Lesson Description: From mirrors to prisms and basic lenses We start taking steps into optical designs by
      building on the knowledge gained. Learn about virtual images, internal reflection,
      spherical and aspherical lenses as well as the types of glass used to make lenses. Learn
      how to read a lens diagram and extract crucial information from lens specifications.
  - Lesson Title: Lenses and Images
    Lesson Description: Photographic lenses create images. What are the characteristics that affect those
      images? Focal length and magnification, as well as the gauss formula and how basic lens
      systems are designed a telescope and the Leko Source Four lamp are covered in this
      video.
  - Lesson Title: Style Through Aberrations
    Lesson Description: Lens personality is expressed through its flaws Aberrations. Learn all about spherical
      aberration, chromatic aberration, coma, astigmatism, field curvature, vignetting,
      distortion and breathing. Why do they occur? Are they a problem to solve or a creative
      opportunity to use? Learn about optical designs used to solve aberrations so that you
      can make informed decisions when picking your lens.
  - Lesson Title: Advanced Lens Systems
    Lesson Description: How are simple lenses combined to create complex systems? We will learn principles
      through examining common lens systems Telephoto, Retrofocus, Telecentric, Macro and
      other designs as we use the principles and vocabulary gained.
  - Lesson Title: When the Lens Meets a Camera
    Lesson Description: A lens is not operating in a vacuum. Once a camera is connected, everything changes. In
      fact, lenses are often designed with specific camera types in mind. Learn what happens
      when a sensor receives an image created by a lens, and how the optical stack inside the
      camera alters the image, no matter what lens is attached. From film formats to digital
      sensors, image circle, crop factor and more.
  - Lesson Title: The Secrets of the Aperture
    Lesson Description: One of the most creative tools in the lens, the aperture, is often misunderstood and
      misused. Gain an in-depth understanding of this unique tool How does it work? Depth of
      field, circle of confusion, depth of focus, f/stop and T-stops, and why the same
      aperture setting does not mean the same thing across different lenses.
  - Lesson Title: All About Focus
    Lesson Description: How does a lens achieve focus, and what happens when it doesn't? Learn all about
      depth-of-field, bokeh and focus splitting, as well as focusing technologies such as unit
      focusing or floating element focusing and how they affect the image created by a lens.
  - Lesson Title: Zooms and Primes
    Lesson Description: How does a zoom lens work and how to pick the right one for you? Learn about zoom
      technology, from parfocal to varifocal as well as aperture ramping. Additionally, we
      continue into other aspects of photographic lenses lens mounts, back focus and the
      flange focal distance. Flare is examined in depth, covering its common types and causes
      Veiling glare, ghosting, and narcissism. Finally we dive into lens coatings.
  - Lesson Title: Special Optical Tools
    Lesson Description: Lenses are often used along other tools and devices. We cover common accessories, as
      well as special lens types now that we are able to truly understand how they operate and
      the principles governing them Converters, extenders, speed boosters, tilt & shift
      lenses, diopters, ND filters and IR pollution, polarizers and more.
  - Lesson Title: Anamorphic Lenses
    Lesson Description: A special video is dedicated to this unique type of lens which defined the word
      'cinematic'. We cover the history and technology of anamorphic lenses and why they are
      so popular, as well as the differences between the different types of anamorphic lenses
      front or rear adapter, as well as their combination with modern large format digital
      cameras.
  - Lesson Title: Picking the Right Lens
    Lesson Description: Is it really all about sharpness? We look closely at the number one characteristic and
      learn how to look beyond the marketing hypes. Learn how to use lens testing charts, MTF
      diagrams and lens projectors, as well as what happens when photosites meet a high
      resolution image created by a lens. From the Nyquist sampling rate through resolution,
      the low pass filter and much more.
  - Lesson Title: Designing a Lens Test
    Lesson Description: You are now ready to bring all the newfound knowledge together and design a lens test.
      Learn about quantitative vs qualitative lens testing, factoring a camera into the test
      as well as designing the test scene. Learn to analyze the results and make informed
      decisions.
  - Lesson Title: Handling Lenses
    Lesson Description: We conclude our in-depth series by covering best practices when handling lenses
      professionally. How are lenses stored and handled on set? What happens when a problem
      occurs, such as dropping a lens and how to clean a lens without damaging it.
