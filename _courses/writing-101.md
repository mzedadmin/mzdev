  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Introduction
    Lesson Description: In the opening module to the course Seth introduces himself
      and talks about how he'd like you to approach this course.
  - Lesson Title: The Ideafest
    Lesson Description: One of the easiest aspects of writing is coming up with an
      idea. Or maybe a bunch of ideas, but they aren't a complete structured story.
      In this lesson Seth gives an introduction to his strategies to extract your
      story organically.
  - Lesson Title: Structure
    Lesson Description: Seth gives us an overview of the classic three-act-structure,
      distilling sources such as Joseph Campbell and Blake Schneider, before explaining
      how you can use this as a guideline to further massage your ideas into a story
      outline.
  - Lesson Title: Archetypes
    Lesson Description: Character archetypes are another established writing convention
      and in this module Seth runs through Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey" model
      for defining your story's characters.
  - Lesson Title: Theme
    Lesson Description: Every story has a theme - it may be subtle or pronounced but
      without it there's no thread tying the events together. Here Seth defines theme
      as it applies to screenwriting and discussed why you might choose to write from
      the theme rather than writing from the characters.
  - Lesson Title: The Clock
    Lesson Description: In this lesson Seth introduces us to the story clock, an idea
      attributed to filmmaker JJ Abrams which gives you a 10,000 foot view of your
      story.
  - Lesson Title: Your Clock
    Lesson Description: Continuing to explore the story clock tool, Seth walks through
      an example of his creative process writing the short film "Old/New"
  - Lesson Title: The Writing
    Lesson Description: Here Seth shares with us perhaps his most important strategy
      in writing, combine the concepts of micro and macro clocking to give you a manageable
      strategy to be productive in your screenwriting.
  - Lesson Title: Formatting
    Lesson Description: Screenplays have a very standardised format and presentation.
      In this lesson Seth gives you a complete rundown of everything you need to know
      to ensure your script is to a professional standard and gives you the best chance
      of it being read.
  - Lesson Title: Limitations
    Lesson Description: In the closing lesson to the course Seth discusses the inevitable
      limitations that come with writing, and how you can harness them to make your
      story better.
  - Lesson Title: The Resources

      available with the course.
