  - Text: Great course!!!
    Reviewer: Renan F.
  - Text: Loved the course, but it did leave me wanting more. I hope to see more ARRI
      courses on fixtures and maybe a console course would be amazing. Many thanks!
    Reviewer: Wayne R.
  - Text: There is a lot to cover from signal types to equipment. It acheived a demystification
      of a number of topics and gave me more confidence in the process. I could easily
      see another 30 minutes of hands on demonstration to give it more perspective.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: DMX
    Lesson Description: Richard Cadena explains how to build a bulletproof DMX network,
      along with the essential terms and tools, such as DMX universe, fixture personalities,
      and more.
  - Lesson Title: Troubleshooting a DMX Network
    Lesson Description: When set up correctly, DMX networks are incredibly reliable
      however if something goes wrong you need to have a clear strategy for finding
      your solution. In this module, we will take an in-depth look at the best practices
      of setting and troubleshooting DMX network.
  - Lesson Title: RDM
    Lesson Description: Most modern fixtures have built-in Remote Device Management
      capabilities, which allows users to send a variety of commands without a need
      to climb the ladder and adjust settings through the menu. In this lesson, Richard
      explains the ways RDM protocol can be used to streamline your lighting workflow.
  - Lesson Title: Wireless DMX
    Lesson Description: With so much new technology becoming more reliable, it’s easier
      than ever to build your lighting system using wireless DMX. In this episode,
      Richard Cadena explains best practices for setting your own wireless system
      and explores the most common issues.
  - Lesson Title: Introduction to Ethernet-based Networking
    Lesson Description: Live events, broadcast studios and big movie sets require
      larger lighting systems that demand multiple universes of DMX. To enable higher
      performance and efficiency for these lighting systems, Ethernet is the go-to.
      Richard Cadena explains the concept and necessary equipment for building ethernet
      lighting networks.
  - Lesson Title: Testing Ethernet-based Networks
    Lesson Description: Follow along this live demonstration of PING and IPCONFIG
      commands to get you started on a journey to learn how to test and troubleshoot
      ethernet-based networks.
  - Lesson Title: Art-Net
    Lesson Description: In this module, you will get a deep dive into one of the open
      ethernet protocols - Art-Net.
  - Lesson Title: Streaming ACN (sACN)
    Lesson Description: Learn the difference between ArtNet and Streaming ACN, and
      how to choose a protocol that will be right for you.
  - Lesson Title: Consoles
    Lesson Description: In this module, Richard Cadena explores types of consoles,
      software, and basics of console programming to start creating lighting designs.
  - Lesson Title: ARRI LED Ecosystem
    Lesson Description: 'ARRI’s Systems Engineer Patrick Schulze introduces the ARRI
      LED ecosystem that consists of four elements: software, hardware, communication
      and control. You will learn about SkyPanel and L-Series fixtures’ software,
      wireless DMX system SkyLink and a control app for iOS and Android – Stellar.'
