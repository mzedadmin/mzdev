      interested in starting a YouTube channel. You have to build a strong foundation
      when you're starting out, which can be tricky if you're not sure where to begin.
      In this episode, we'll help you decide what you should be talking about in your
      videos. We'll also discuss the importance of being consistent, knowing your
      goals, and dealing with negative opinions. Knowing your niche is key, so great
      job for taking the first step!
  - Lesson Title: How to Set Up Your YouTube Channel
    Lesson Description: There's a lot of detail that goes into setting up your YouTube
      channel. We'll run the whole process with you, from getting a new email, choosing
      your channel name, and adding a channel description. From there, we'll teach
      you how to customize the layout of your channel, manage your videos, and choose
      relevant keywords. Your channel might be the first thing new viewers will see,
      so it's important that it's customized to your brand and personality.
  - Lesson Title: Creative Workflow
    Lesson Description: You have now set up your channel and you're ready to shoot.
      Where do you begin? After you figure out the kind of videos you want to make,
      the next step is to generate ideas around it. In the pre-production phase of
      your shoot, learn how to create a script, attach b-roll shots, and finalize
      a shot list. This is a big chunk of the production process, so make sure it's
      of value to yourself and to your audience.

      are so many options out there, so we'll help you figure out what kind of equipment
      you'll need based on the type of content you want to make. Remember, equipment
      is only secondary to the most important thing about your videos the story. In
      this episode, we'll help you narrow down the tools you'll need to get started.
  - Lesson Title: Editing Workflow from Start to Finish
    Lesson Description: Post-production is the last big chunk of the production process,

      and choosing the right audio. While it may seem like there are many small steps
      necessary to be successful with editing, it will definitely be worth it in the
      long run. After all, this is the stage where your story comes together.

      far!
  - Lesson Title: Promote
    Lesson Description: Putting your video out there is one thing, but promoting is
      a real key to success. It won't matter how amazing your video is if no one sees
      it. There are many ways to promote on YouTube, but the tool you need to be familiar
      with is social media. Each social media platform has its perks, to enable the
      best promotion for your content. Take the time to study each one and see what
      works for you.

      other YouTubers and how else you can grow.

      into collaborations. Think of it as making friendships that will help you grow.
      There are many ways to reach out to other YouTubers, but there is, however,
      a right and proper way to do so. Growth is something you can't really do alone,
      so be open to the many opportunities YouTube has to offer.
  - Lesson Title: How to Stay Motivated and Succeed
    Lesson Description: No matter what YouTube is to you, at the end of the day, it's
      still very much a job and a business. It can get tiring. It happens to all YouTubers.
      It's important that you have the right mindset when dealing with negative comments
      and burnout. The next step is figuring out how you can sustain your motivation

      you. How you deal with it is up to you.

      affiliate programs, and Patreon. Think of these perks as a way to further support
      your YouTube brand so you can support yourself financially while creating the
