  Reviews:
  - Text: It is a great course with many useful 'real-world' pieces of advice from
      high-level cinematographers. It is not the kind of knowledge you can easily
      find for free online.
    Reviewer: Gustavo F.
  - Text: I recommend the course to anyone interested in learning lighting techniques
      for interviews along with advice on framing. The teachers are very professional
      and prepared and combine theoretical explanations with practical examples.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Indoor Lighting with Paul Atkins, ASC
    Lesson Description: "In Lesson 1, Paul Atkins, ASC, one of the most renowned wildlife
      cinematographers in the world, teaches indoor on-location lighting of people
      to a diverse group of young filmmakers. \n\nHe talks about camera angles and
      positioning, eyelines, direction of the light, and achieving naturalistic looking
      lighting depending on your location. He experiments with the positioning of
      the key light and how it changes the look of the subject in front of the camera
      including how shadows fall. \n\nPaul talks about big light sources vs. small
      ones, and shows the effect of reflecting surfaces as well as spill light, and
      how to control it with black floppies, and so much more. At the end of the session,
      he answers lots of student questions on lighting and shooting interviews."
  - Lesson Title: Outdoor Lighting with Paul Atkins, ASC
    Lesson Description: "In Lesson 2, Paul Atkins, ASC, transfers what he taught in
      Lesson 1 into a very simple and everyday outdoors situation during harsh sunlight.
      He deals with getting an acceptable image and explains why he recommends always
      shooting into the sun outdoors. \n\nPaul touches on how to adjust for various
      skin complexions in outdoor lighting, and how to get more contrast even on light
      skin tones when the sun is out. In conversation with the students, they also
      discuss what to do if it's overcast and how to change the setup. The importance
      of having eyelight is mentioned and explained how to achieve it in any situation.
      Diffusing sunlight is shown in practice with frames and diffusion. \n\nThe students
      ask practical questions from documentary shooting outdoors - how to shoot interviews
      on a boat, for example. Paul also goes into practical considerations like choosing
      the right time of day for an interview, the right location, the right clothing
      for interviewees, and so on. Lighting is also creating shade when needed to
      create contrast, especially outside, and using reflectors to create a natural
      looking image without artificial light (or as a fill light)."
  - Lesson Title: Indoor Lighting with Stephen Lighthill, ASC
    Lesson Description: "In his first indoor lighting session of the workshop, master
      cinematographer and former ASC president Stephen Lighthill, ASC, challenges
      the students to tell him what their plan is to light the room, and then gives
      his comments about their suggestions. \n\nHe talks about the problem of working
      under existing fluorescent tubes in a room when you are shooting an interview
      on-location, and how to manage different circumstances - lights you can swap
      vs. lights you have to live with, and how you can modify their look. \n\nStephen
      talks about how to tackle different challenges when working with windows - in
      shot and off shot. They talk about working with multiple cameras in an interview
      and what compromises that would mean for the lighting setup. They run through
      various focal lengths and show the different effect that has on the face in
      front of the camera in combination with the lighting. Towards the end of the
      lesson, Stephen shows how to light a setup at a bar."
  - Lesson Title: Outdoor Lighting with Stephen Lighthill, ASC
    Lesson Description: "In his outdoor lesson, Stephen starts by advising the students
      to look at the direction the sun is moving and plan for that. He then proceeds
      to talk about the sweet spot of various lenses and how to find it - and what
      not to do with them. \n\nStephen shares his rule of thumb that you should reflect
      the key light in order to get a natural looking fill light. He talks about the
      importance of eye light and shows his favorite positioning of a key light -
      in this case, a large white bounce board. They then swap to a strong LED light
      and show how easily a portrait shot will look \"lit\" outside if not used correctly.
      Stephen talks about the importance of consistency in lighting, framing and lens
      selection within one production, and much more."
