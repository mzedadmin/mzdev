  - Text: Drew Geraci is an excellent teacher! His teaching style, pace and information
      are engaging. The course goes through everything you need to get up and running
      as a pro. You just need to go out and shoot!
    Reviewer: Laurence K.
  - Text: Terrific course on timelapse photography! Lots of great tips and practical
      information on how to deal with variables in the field. I love that he uses
      Davinci Resolve to process everything, so much easier than the old way of needing
      Lightroom and LRTimelapse. Great stuff!
