  - Text: There are many masterclasses that are quick and lack depth, however, this
      really was a great learning experience. Not many DP's like to share information
      like this and it was so refreshing to listen to James Laxton. His passion for
      cinematography and his passion for film is inspirational and you finish the
      masterclass with sense of true passion for the art as well.

  - Text: An amazing experience to know how James Laxton worked in his two last movies.
      I was already big fan of the movies and now, knowing about the details of his
      cinematography, I felt proud! Congrats !!

  - Text: James does a great job inviting the audience to have an open conversation
      about cinematography. It starts off a little slow with the interview and camera
      angles we see, but then it quickly ramps up into conversations about lighting
      and we even get to see James in action creating different setups with more artistic
      goals, and pushing the camera and scene to the visual limits. Very informative
      and creatively inspiring workshop.
