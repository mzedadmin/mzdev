  - Text: Wu is dropping nuggets you would never hear about from many people in the
      industry. His course is like the dark side of the business that affects your
      life but that you might not know how to navigate. He hands you the whole map
      on a golden plate. Thank you, brother! I am glad you took the time to teach
      this course.
    Reviewer: Rodney K.
  - Text: Really good, definitely worth it. It gives the all the basic things you
      will need to know on having to jump into your first film. Learned so much and
      also learned that I have to learn so much more!
    Reviewer: Dylan K.
  - Text: The teacher is prepared. It does not deal with technical things but tells
      the life and challenges that a filmmaker who wants to start this career must
      face.

  Lessons:
  - Lesson Title: Rules of the Indie Game
    Lesson Description: "Many first time indie filmmakers get so burned out on their
      first film, that they never go on to make another film. Join Rubidium as he
      talks you through the ways to make indie filmmaking a long-term career rather
      than a one-time sprint. \n\nFrom avoiding pitfalls to learning how to embrace
      the daily challenges, this lesson also dives into how to develop your film ideas
      based around the resources you already have in your life and network."
  - Lesson Title: Genre
    Lesson Description: "When you're first brainstorming a film idea, it's important
      to decide on a film genre. Studios use a film's genre to estimate the amount
      they expect to spend and also make from a film. \n\nAs an indie filmmaker, there
      are a few genres that you're more likely to achieve with a small budget, such
      as horror, and other genres that are expensive and typically better to avoid,
      such as Science Fiction or Action."
  - Lesson Title: The Pitch
    Lesson Description: "Refining your film pitch is an essential piece to getting
      your film written, produced, and sold. Starting with your immediate network
      of friends and family, you can often tell how successful your film idea might
      be by gauging the initial reaction to your pitch. \n\nWhether it's the film
      idea itself or your pitch delivery, you'll want to refine your pitch again and
      again during your filmmaking journey."
  - Lesson Title: The Screenplay
    Lesson Description: Should you write your own film script, or hire a writer? How
      do you go from a film idea, to a treatment, beat list, and then the screenplay?
      How refined should your script be before you're ready to get it made? In this
      lesson you'll get a ton of real world advice for the script writing phase of
      your indie film project.
  - Lesson Title: The Budget
    Lesson Description: "Your total budget is how you transform dollars to film scenes,
      and it will dictate how you approach nearly every aspect of your production.
      In this lesson you'll learn the typical budget levels, such as a $10,000 film
      versus a $50,000 film versus a $200,000 film. \n\nEach level will give you a
      different amount of days to shoot, number of locations, and the type of actors
      you can afford to cast, which can determine if your film has a built-in audience
      with some guarantee of interest from fans of the actors."
  - Lesson Title: Raising Money
    Lesson Description: It can take a lot more time and work to finance your film
      than it does to actually make it. Whether you're asking your friends and family
      to support your undertaking, or you're crowdfunding online, or you're sitting
      down with investors, there are a few things you can do to ensure you get the
      money you need to make your indie film a reality.
  - Lesson Title: Assembling a Team
    Lesson Description: "Once you begin your film's production, you'll need to line
      up your crew. The difference between a $10,000 film and a $100,000 film can
      mean a lot more crew members on set, which also adds a lot more expenses to
      manage that crew. \n\nFor a no budget film, you may only have a director/writer,
      producer, cinematographer, focus puller or assistant camera, and a sound recorder.
      As you increase your budget, you may add more a gaffer and grip, hair and makeup,
      art director, script supervisor, assistant director, executive producers, and
      other roles both on set and off."
  - Lesson Title: Legal & Insurance
    Lesson Description: "Now for the nitty gritty business of filmmaking, Rubidium
      walks you through all the required insurances for a film, including Errors &
      Omissions (E&O), general liability, vehicle and workers compensation insurance.
      \n\nYou can often lower the total cost and hassle of both insurance as well
      as payroll by hiring co-production companies who specialize in being the employer
      of record for independent productions."
  - Lesson Title: Casting
    Lesson Description: "Casting your lead and supporting actors may be the most important
      decision you make for your film. Learn how to cast professionally and efficiently
      with a rented space, auditions, callbacks, table reads, rejection calls, and
      more. \n\nYou'll also learn what to do when an investor would like a friend
      or family member to be cast in your film."
  - Lesson Title: Locations & Schedule
    Lesson Description: "The art and science of planning your shooting days is where
      movie magic really happens. Shooting locations can be found through online searches
      such as Peerspace or Gigster, and standing sets that are all ready for shooting
      can be a life saver for your schedule. \n\nBut scouting locations with your
      crew, arranging the shooting schedule to be as efficient as possible, and limiting
      location changes throughout the day can be the difference between a smooth film
      production and an unprofessional nightmare for the cast and crew."
  - Lesson Title: Pre-Production
    Lesson Description: "During the final moments of your film's planning before you
      start shooting, you have several opportunities to solidify any remaining questions
      and unknowns and ensure that production will be as smooth as possible. Scouting
      a location with your crew leads is an essential step to bonding creatively with
      everyone who will help your set locations look and sound the best they can.
      \n\nThese days, previs, or pre-visualization, illustrates your scenes to cast
      and crew in a 3D animated version. Most importantly, actor rehearsals give you
      the final chance to get over any barriers before you start shooting and lock
      in your picture."
  - Lesson Title: Gear & Transport
    Lesson Description: "In this lesson, Rubidium walks you through all the best practices
      for dealing with gear during a film shoot. On any given film, it's usually a
      lot of small details that together work to make a film look great. So the camera,
      lenses, lighting, locations, art direction, talent, makeup, and the film grade
      all contribute equally to the look of a film. Some filmmakers might be tempted
      to rent an unfamiliar camera for their film shoot, like going up to a RED or
      an ALEXA, but it's better to use the gear you're already comfortable with. \n\nAnd
      when it comes to renting gear, a good rental house will give you a great discount,
      you'll be able to get all your gear from one location, and if you rent a Uhaul
      or a van you can keep all your production gear in one vehicle without loading
      and unloading it each day."
  - Lesson Title: The Shoot
    Lesson Description: "Finally we get to the shooting stage of your indie film.
      In this lesson you'll learn some technical recommendations about shot variety
      and cutaways, using one versus multiple cameras, and production expenditures.
      \n\nBut more importantly you'll learn how to direct actors and provide criticisms
      that help rather than hinder their performance, how to set aside your normal
      life so you can dedicate yourself fully to the shoot, and how to set the right
      attitude on set."
  - Lesson Title: Post-Production
    Lesson Description: "Many first time indie filmmakers are unprepared for the massive
      task of post production. The average 90 minute feature film takes roughly six
      to 12 months of man hours if you go at it alone. But in this lesson, you'll
      learn about other options and typical processes for editing a film, including
      hiring a post house to walk you through every stage of the edit, to sound design
      and mix, to music composition and delivery. \n\nYou'll also learn the stages
      of an edit from rough assembly to picture lock, and when it's appropriate to
      bring back the actors for ADR or Additional Dialogue Replacement."
  - Lesson Title: Distribution
    Lesson Description: "In the final lesson of the course, Rubidium walks you through
      the opportunities you have to sell your film. Where film festivals have been
      the primary method of showcasing independent films to distributors, nowadays
      streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime are buying films directly
      from filmmakers. \n\nBut how do you get your film in front of distributors?
      What are the benefits of a commission-based sales agent? And how do global regions
      work? Take notes here because this lesson will be all about how you make your
      indie filmmaking journey worthwhile - and sustainable - so you can recoup costs,
      pay your investors, and go on to make more films."
