### **Contest Rules**

 

  * You have to be a current MZed Pro member at the time of your submission. All entries are due 11:59PM on December 31, 2020 Pacific Time.

  * You must submit an original video, 45-60 seconds long, with your own footage.

  * It's ok to use music in your video, but if you do you'll _also_ need to submit a duplicate version that is music-free. 

  * You must include something about how MZed Pro has impacted you.

  * You must end the video with the line "I'm _full name_ and I'm an MZed Pro." (replacing _full name_ with your first and last name).




 

After all the entries have been submitted, MZed staff will judge the videos on a variety of attributes, from originality, to video execution, to story and style. We'll select the winner on January 9, 2021 and announce it shortly after.

Here are a few examples of MZed Pros telling their story. After you watch these, we bet you'll be able to create a video much better than theirs! (_Just kidding! We love you John, Sarah, Lyanna, and Genki_).

## **The Prize - Canon EOS C70 Cinema Camera**

New cameras have been releasing in abundance recently, but the Canon C70 has stirred up more attention and excitement than just about any cinema camera since the original C100 or C300. The [Canon C70 announcement at Newsshooter](https://www.newsshooter.com/2020/09/24/canon-eos-c70/) has over 200 comments on it alone - clearly this camera is highly anticipated.

![canon-eos-c70-rf-mount](https://mzed-cdn1.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/news/canon-eos-c70-rf-mount.jpg)

What we love about the C70 is that it appears to be targeting the active filmmaker, the do-er, the road warrior who loves the art of video storytelling more than the exercise of gear and spec discussion. This is a camera for the zelous creatives, which is precisely how we characterize MZed Pro members.

As an MZed Pro you are hungry to learn, to watch more lessons, to improve your abilities. You are here to _become_ a better filmmaker, so you can go out and _be_ a better storyteller. You already have the access to the education, and now you have the oportunity to win one of the most capable and versatile new cameras available!

![canon-c70-filmmaking](https://mzed-cdn1.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/news/canon-c70-filmmaking.jpg)

We know that as an MZed Pro member you have the ability to create a 45-60 second video about yourself in no time. So stop thinking about it and do it!

### **Eligibility and Fine Print**

 

The "I'm an MZed Pro" contest is open to anyone around the world who is at least 18 years of age and is a member of MZed Pro at the time of submission. You must be a member for at least 14 days prior to submission, to ensure legitimacy of your opinions and experience with MZed Pro. If your membership expires at some time between your submission date and the date of the prize drawing, you will still be eligible. 

Only one submission per member is allowed; a video with a music bed requires an additional duplicate submission without the music bed, which together will count as one submission. Your video must include the phrase "I'm _full name_ and I'm an MZed Pro", where _full name_ is substituted with your first and last names (eg. "I'm Monte Zucker and I'm an MZed Pro").

Your email to [marketing@mzed.com](mailto:marketing@mzed.com) along with a successful upload to the Dropbox link provided will serve as your submission - a confirmation email from MZed will confirm your entry. In the case of a duplicate submission, the last entry submitted prior to deadline will be considered the valid entry.

Entries close at 11:59PM on December 31, 2020 (Pacific time) and judging will occur from January 1-9, 2021, after which the winner will be selected and contacted via email. Once the winner has confirmed the prize terms and delivery, the winner will be announced on this site, as well as MZed social media channels. The winner will be responsible for any customs or tax liabilities as a result of receiving the Canon C70, valued at $5,499.

MZed staff, family, business partners and affiliates are not eligible to win. The winning submission will be chosen by MZed staff based on a variety of factors, including originality, execution, story, and style.

By submitting a video into the "I'm an MZed Pro" contest, you are transferring the rights to the material in the video to MZed, who can use both the audio and video media to market and promote MZed.
