Each month we'll be randomly drawing an MZed Pro member to win a variety of gear, and the good news is you don't have to do anything. No entry form, no 10 million bonus entries, you don't even have to get out of bed for this monthly giveaway. If you're an active MZed Pro member at the time of the drawing, you'll be automatically entered.

But wait, there's more! We've got other exciting changes coming to MZed soon, including new member benefits, new courses, a better viewing experience, and some other news we're not ready to reveal just yet.

So if you're on the fence about MZed Pro, now is a great time to join and soak in everything that MZed Pro has to offer.

## ****November Gear Giveaway - Atomos Shogun 7 Pro/Cinema Monitor-Recorder-Switcher****

For our first member giveaway, one lucky MZed Pro subscriber will win an [Atomos Shogun 7](https://www.atomos.com/shogun7). If you don't already know about the Shogun 7, this is a seven-inch HDR monitor, recorder, and switcher powerhouse that has become an industry standard among filmmaking professionals.

Utilizing either an HDMI or SDI feed, the Shogun 7 outputs a mind blowing 3000 nits of peak brightness, with a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. The ability to monitor HDR in resolutions up to DCI 4k at 60p, and up to 2k at 240p.

Its native AtomHDR Log display enables you to more accurately monitor your log gamma footage without having to view flat, washed-out images or use a LUT To compress the dynamic range and color space. There are built-in presets for log formats from ARRI, Canon, Fujifilm, Nikon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony cameras.

The Shogun 7 Pro/Cinema can also record and provide on-screen switching for up to four camera feeds. It records the four ISOs in addition to the program, which will help you achieve your multi-camera shoots with a breeze. It will also generate a multicam .xml file for instant multicam editing with Final Cut Pro.

On top of all that, the Shogun 7 can record up to DCI 4k60 to ProRes Raw, ProRes, Cinema DMG, and DNxHD. This isn't just an external monitor/recorder, this is a game changer for your filmmaking capabilities.

We'll draw the winner from our active MZed Pro members on November 30, 2020 at 9PM PST. If you've got an MZed Pro membership at that time, you're automatically entered to win!
