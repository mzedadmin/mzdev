In a nutshell, you'll have to produce a 10-second video telling us "why YOU deserve to get one of the 10 cameras FUJIFILM is giving away for FREE". Upload the video on Instagram OR YouTube and use the hashtag **#10xFUJIFILMxCINED**. Next, you'll sign up for our contest, (for Instagram) follow CineD's and FUJIFILM's Instagrams, tag 5 friends OR (for YouTube) subscribe to CineD's YouTube channel, as well as subscribe to each newsletter. Et voilà!

## CineD's Production Tip

While it is very tempting to spontaneously create a short 10 seconds video and share it with us, our advice to you is to take a minute before doing so. Think about our question, ("Why do you deserve to get the camera for free"), and try to come up with something engaging, funny, or, emotional. Telling a "story" in 10 seconds is not so easy, yet, creating something that you will be happy with should be your goal, and will increase your chances of winning!

_Good luck to all of you! We look forward to seeing your creations on Instagram and YouTube._

**What a great chance to win the new FUJIFILM X-H2S camera and $1000 in cash. Will you participate in the contest and try to convince us why you deserve to get one of the 10 cameras we give? Tell us in the comment section below!**
