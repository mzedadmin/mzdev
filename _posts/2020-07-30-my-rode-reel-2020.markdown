## **WHAT IS MY R ØDE REEL?**

Over the last six years, more than 16,000 films have been submitted to the competition from 94 different countries, with RØDE awarding over $3.5 million in prizes to both emerging and established filmmakers. My RØDE Reel has also launched hundreds of careers by providing a global platform for filmmakers to gain exposure, offering grants and scholarships, and giving away lots of RØDE microphones and filmmaking gear.

## **THE PRIZES & CATEGORIES**

The winners of My RØDE Reel 2020 will receive a share of US $1 million, the biggest cash prize ever offered in a short film competition.

"Giving creatives a leg up has always been fundamental to what we do as a company," says **R ØDE CEO Damien Wilson**. "People in the film industry are doing it tough right now. This year, we wanted to not only give entrants the chance to win RØDE mics and awesome gear, but also offer a substantial amount of money to help kickstart the career of the next big thing, fund new projects, or cover living expenses so filmmakers can continue to work through these trying times. This money will make a big difference for a lot of people."
