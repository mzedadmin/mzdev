Now that we seem to have more than enough cameras to satisfy our filmmaking needs, it's a good time to focus on lenses, and in particular [specialty lenses](https://www.cined.com/gear-guides/specialty-lenses/). Let's take a quick look at what you can do with a tilt-shift lens.

In ["The Secrets of Optics" course on MZed](https://www.mzed.com/courses/the-secrets-of-optics), educator Mitch Gross dedicates a module specifically to specialty optics and adapters. The lesson on tilt shift lenses, or "shift and tilt" lenses as they're sometimes called, goes into some detail about when it makes sense to reach for a lens that lets you manipulate the focal plane.

## Getting started with tilt shift lenses

Unlike spherical lenses which have the mount and the body of the lens locked together, a tilt-shift lens frees the body of the lens to move around. So now you can essentially "see around a corner" or look sideways at an object.

The immediate effect of this is you can change the depth of field to do things that a regular lens can't do. As you move the tilt-shift lens around, you can get a unique look where only a part of the image is in focus and the rest falls off into a blur.

For close subjects, this makes for an interesting stylistic effect. Here's a photo I took of my neighbor, using a Lensbaby Sol tilt-shift lens. There's an almost radial look to the out-of-focus area around the subject.

From a filmmaker's point of view, you can use a tilt-shift lens to shoot two subjects at an angle, while keeping them both in focus. Essentially, you're arcing the front of the lens so that two subjects are both at a parallel angle of light.

A good use for this effect would be shooting a driver and passenger in a car, where your camera is placed at the driver side window and you want to have both subjects in focus, without stopping the aperture down to dramatically increase the depth of field.

One of the primary use cases for a tilt-shift lens is when capturing architecture or tall buildings. With a standard lens, the vanishing perspective lines will distort the building into a triangular shape. It's especially noticeable for tall buildings.

But with a tilt-shift lens, you can modify the angle of the lens so that the image of the building squares up. The vertical lines of the building will run parallel to each other rather than pointing inwards.

In ["The Secrets of Optics" course](https://www.mzed.com/courses/the-secrets-of-optics), Mitch goes into more detail about tilt-shift lenses, using some in-studio examples. To further demonstrate the effects, I shot some footage using a Canon tilt-shift lens on a Canon C300 Mark II. The Specialty Optics module also includes discussions on macro and anamorphic lenses.

## Time-lapse with tilt shift lenses

One of the more popular ways to use tilt-shift lenses in video production is to capture wide scenes via time-lapse. The sped-up footage, along with only a small area being in focus, gives you the ability to miniaturize the world.

In [this lesson of Philip Bloom's Cinematic Masterclass](https://www.mzed.com/courses/philip-bloom-cinematic-masterclass/modules/6), you can see a few examples of this effect. Philip recommends finding a scene where there are people, cars, boats, or other kinds of motion we expect notions of what we should see.

The key to effective tilt-shift timelapse is choosing subjects that have recognizable scale references. When viewers see cars, people, or boats moving in the frame, but they appear toy-like due to the selective focus, it creates the compelling miniature illusion.

## Technical considerations for tilt-shift lenses

When working with tilt-shift lenses, there are several technical aspects to keep in mind:

**Manual focus only:** Most tilt-shift lenses are manual focus, requiring careful attention to focus pulling, especially when the lens is tilted or shifted.

**Exposure changes:** Shifting the lens can sometimes cause slight exposure variations across the frame, particularly with extreme shifts.

**Lens coverage:** Not all tilt-shift lenses provide full coverage when shifted to extremes, potentially causing vignetting or reduced image quality at the edges.

**Slower workflow:** The manual nature and precision required for tilt-shift work typically slows down shooting compared to standard lenses.

## Creative applications beyond architecture

While tilt-shift lenses are most commonly associated with architectural photography, their creative applications extend far beyond:

**Portrait photography:** Creating selective focus effects that draw attention to specific facial features while beautifully blurring the background.

**Product photography:** Controlling exactly which parts of a product are in sharp focus, ideal for highlighting specific features or details.

**Landscape photography:** Using the shift function to avoid tilting the camera when shooting from high or low angles, maintaining natural perspective.

**Macro work:** The tilt function can help maximize depth of field in macro photography by aligning the lens plane with the subject plane.

## Popular tilt-shift lens options

Several manufacturers offer quality tilt-shift lenses:

**Canon:** The TS-E series includes 17mm, 24mm, 50mm, 90mm, and 135mm options with both tilt and shift movements.

**Nikon:** PC-E lenses in 24mm, 45mm, and 85mm focal lengths offer professional-grade tilt-shift capabilities.

**Lensbaby:** More affordable creative options like the Composer Pro and Sol series provide tilt effects with artistic flair.

**Samyang/Rokinon:** Budget-friendly 24mm tilt-shift option that provides basic movements at a lower price point.
