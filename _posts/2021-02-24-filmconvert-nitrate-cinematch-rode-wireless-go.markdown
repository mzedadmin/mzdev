There are some exciting giveaways coming up for MZed Pro members as part of our monthly member giveaway. But first, who won January's prize?

In January we gave away a new [iFootage Shark Slider Nano](http://www.ifootagegear.com/products/shark-slider-nano), a tiny electronic slider that also happens to be the world's smallest 2-axis motion control slider. Whether you want to capture a simultaneous pan-and-slide with static objects, or you want that coveted parallax effect for an interview B-cam, the Shark Slider Nano looks to be an essential kit for video producers.

Congratulations to MZed Pro member Michael M. for winning the iFootage Shark Slider Nano! We're excited for you and please send us some sweet 2-axis footage when you receive the slider.

## **FilmConvert Nitrate and CineMatch**

For our February giveaway, we have a special post-production package that will make the winner really happy, as it will save them a ton of time. 

 

FilmConvert has been the premiere film color grading plugin for years, especially as they've been adding specific camera color profiles shortly after new cameras are released. It's been such a reliable way to grade that FilmConvert has become much more than a film emulation software. Many editors are known to skip the LUT and color correction stage of editing and simply apply a FilmConvert effect over all their footage.

With Nitrate, FilmConvert is now more advanced than ever, with custom NLE plugins for Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, and Final Cut Pro X. The advanced controls, along with new hardware acceleration, lets you play with your grade in an unlimited number of ways. [Learn more about FilmConvert Nitrate here](https://www.filmconvert.com/nitrate).

 

 

The [CineMatch program from FilmConvert](https://www.cinematch.com) adds another layer of convenience if you use a variety of cameras in your productions, which is often the norm. But even with cameras from the same manufacturer using the same picture profile, it can be frustrating to match images from different cameras. 

With CineMatch, you can now match footage from SLog 2 or 3, C-Log, V-Log, BRaw, RED IPP2, and more. It also supports DJI and GoPro cameras, which can be some of the hardest cameras to match with your cinema or DSLR and mirrorless cameras. More importantly, you'll be able to convert your footage from one Log picture profile to another, which will give you a baseline matched project that you can then grade across the board. 

We're excited to give away this FilmConvert Nitrate and CineMatch package - good luck to MZed Pro members!

## **R ØDE****Wireless GO II - March Giveaway**

Just announced this week, the new [RØDE Wireless GO II](https://bhpho.to/3uqPUvu) is the next generation to one of RØDE's most groundbreaking products. The compact wireless audio system now sports a dual channel receiver that supports two transmitters, along with easy connections to not only your camera but your phone or tablet. There's a new safety channel record that ensures you'll never come away with bad audio.

But the truly astounding part of the new Wireless GO is the addition of onboard recording on the transmitters. This has been a feature many have wished for in wireless audio systems, so to finally see it come true on the Wireless Go feels like a long time coming. Now if you happen to run into signal interference, you don't have to worry about losing out on precious audio, as there will always be a clean recording on the transmitters.

There's a lot more to this new release from RØDE and [you can read all about it here](https://bhpho.to/37FQzPO). We wish you the best of luck in winning this prize, and remember that all MZed Pro members are automatically entered to win the monthly giveaway!
