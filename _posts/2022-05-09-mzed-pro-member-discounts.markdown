Many of you already know that MZed is the leading educational membership for filmmakers. One of the many perks of the annual MZed Pro membership is getting access to a variety of discounts. Read on to find out what current partner deals are available!

By signing up for an MZed Pro membership you not only have access to 600+ lessons in 300+ hours but new courses are regularly added to the already 45 available ones. But did you know that there is a long list of partner deals with special offers to pick and choose from, which would cost nearly $10,000 to purchase outright? Apart from getting a free pCloud upgrade to 30 GB lifetime storage, let's take a closer look at the member discounts currently offered.

## **pCloud - Free upgrade to 30 GB lifetime storage**

**![pCloud](https://mzed-cdn1.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/news/pcloud-review-1536x864.jpeg)**

Exclusively for MZed Pro members, you can now get access to a 30 GB lifetime account with [cloud storage provider pCloud](https://partner.pcloud.com/r/66199), at no extra cost. Accessible through the pCloud app or the virtual pCloud drive, you can store your documents on the cloud at no extra cost. The MZed Pro membership enables you to get a discount when upgrading to a higher capacity account, such as 500 GB or 2 TB.

pCloud is a fast and reliable way to share large files, which is perfect for sending video files over to clients and colleagues. Dropbox's slow upload and download speeds can be a pain to deal with, and Google Drive splits up large files into multiple zips, so if you want an alternative, give [pCloud](https://partner.pcloud.com/r/66199) a try.
