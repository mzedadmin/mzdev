**Just in time for Christmas and New Year, we launched our new elaborate course on MZed.com – ["The Language of Lighting"](https://www.mzed.com/courses/the-language-of-lighting?tap_a=17272-420962&tap_s=4360246-c93b29). Held by a seasoned cinematographer and film school educator [Tal Lazar](https://latentimages.com/), this course opens a curtain into the beautiful world of cinematic lighting. Without light, there is no shot. Yet, the new course is not just about lamps and conventions. Lighting is a language communicating information and emotions to the viewer. Seeing and designing it to tell a story is magic on its own. The question is: are you ready to become a wizard?**

[Tal Lazar](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1823574/) teaches at leading film schools such as Columbia University, the American Film Institute, and Sundance Institute. At the same time, he is a practitioner, his knowledge coming from his vast filmmaking experience as a cinematographer and producer. Combining these two areas of expertise, diving deep into the process, and adding a generous pinch of classic film examples, Lazar manages to light up the eyes of anyone – even those, who have no connection to lighting fixtures whatsoever.

The purpose of „The Language of Lighting" is not to turn students into master lighting technicians. Designing light is a collaborative process between many different artists, so understanding how it works and learning to communicate it is beneficial for anyone, be it a director, producer, or cinematographer. That's exactly what you will achieve in roughly 4 hours of this course.

Below, we give you a sneak peek into the first of 9 modules "Seeing Light as a Cinematographer". [Head over here to enroll in "The Language of Lighting" on MZed.com and watch the rest.](https://www.mzed.com/courses/the-language-of-lighting?tap_a=17272-420962&tap_s=4360246-c93b29)

If you haven't been on a film set, the first question that might come to your mind is: why do we need all these expensive lamps, accessories, and a dedicated crew to set it up at all? Why not just use, what's already there? After all, each indoor location nowadays has electricity and lights. Tal Lazar shows on his own example, what happens when you apply only those instead:

![Tal Lazar emulated lighting setup](/assets/images/posts/new-mzed-course-tal-lazar-emulated-light.jpg)

![Tal Lazar real lighting setup](/assets/images/posts/new-mzed-course-tal-lazar-real-light.jpg)

What's the difference between these two images? What's wrong with the second one? Why is the first one better? Some people would say, it feels more cinematic or moody, but it's not only about that. Let's take a look at some of the objectives the lighting has.

To better explain, what lighting does in a film, Tal Lazar shows us a night scene from the Coen brothers masterpiece "[No Country for Old Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_No%2520Country%2520for%2520Old%2520Men)". Watch the first 2 minutes and pay attention to the lights that you see:

<iframe loading="lazy" title="No Country for Old Men (2007) | Chase Scene | 1080p" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZolB0tz0TsE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

Everyone, who tried to film at night (especially in a desert), surely knows that even during the full moon, you won't see anything in the frame. Of course, we can always increase the sensitivity of the camera (the ISO), but it will add significant noise, which is rarely wished for.

> The first and foremost objective lighting serves is a technical one – visibility. A minimum amount of light the camera needs to expose an image.
> 
> Tal Lazar

Secondly, you can't just come to a desert, put two huge light sources, and call it a day. The audience won't buy it. Modern lighting conventions require lighting to be believable, which makes sense, as it increases the overall immersion into the story. When you watched that scene from "No Country for Old Men", did you believe it was all moonlight? I bet. Yet, it wasn't. Lazar points out, that if we look closely, we'll notice some weird effects, that don't make sense.

Learn to see light like a professional cinematographer and design it to tell a story. What is the purpose of lighting in a scene? So many questions are answered in this course by master educator Tal Lazar, utilizing demonstrations and many scenes from great films.

In normal life, moonlight comes from above and lights everything evenly. Why then some parts of this wide shot are dark and some – bright? Yet, it doesn't matter, as long you believe it is real. Filmmakers also make sure to follow significant rules to convince us. For example, the artificial light coming from the car's headlights is brighter, than the moonlight, as it should be. There are other tricks to increase believability, and Lazar shares a lot of them throughout the course.

Imagine a perfect bedroom for a morning scene, with beautiful rays of the rising sun falling through the window. You arrive at such a location and it's a dream come true. Yet the first thing the crew will do is block the sunlight so that they can bring in lamps to create the exact same effect (if it is what you're heading for). Why? Unfortunately, the sun moves faster, than we can film this one particular scene. So, the next objective of lighting is consistency.

Even if you have a naturalistic approach, film exclusively outdoors, and try to use only the available light, you will have to adjust your workflows in order to keep it consistent. (For instance, [read here](https://www.cined.com/nomadland-a-masterclass-in-naturalistic-cinematography-with-dp-joshua-james-richards/) how they nailed this challenge in "Nomadland").

One of the most important objectives of lighting, though, is to tell a story. That's a huge part of filmmaking mastery, on which Tal Lazar focuses in his course. Look at the following film stills from another "No Country for Old Men" scene:

![No Country for Old Men hotel scene lighting 1](/assets/images/posts/new-mzed-course-no-country-hotel-1.jpg)

![No Country for Old Men hotel scene lighting 3](/assets/images/posts/new-mzed-course-no-country-hotel-3.jpg)

Putting apart the story of protagonist Llewelyn Moss, what can you say from these images by how they are lit? It is night. He is in a hotel room, higher than the first floor (judging by the light falling from the street lamps). There is someone outside, as the rays of a fluorescent lamp come through the crack under the door. We know that all, even when we don't see the sources because we are familiar with what light looks like in different situations.

Brilliant, right? And that's also one of the exercises every filmmaker and lighting designer should obtain: looking at the world around them and taking notes of effects created by light.

> The best lighting inspiration comes from reality. We call this process emulating – recreating the effect of lighting using lamps.
> 
> Tal Lazar

That's also part of what the chosen set-up for Lazar's course does. It emulates daylight on a sunny day, falling through the half-open blinds, which creates a friendly and natural look in a dull and featureless studio.

To achieve brilliant lighting in a collaborative process, we need to know exactly, how to describe it. The better you are at communication, the faster and closer to your vision the results will be. Learning the language of lighting is what the entire course by Tal Lazar is. So, here are four basic characteristics of lighting to start with:

-   Intensity (bright or dim);
-   Angle/direction (is it high or low? From which side does it come?);
-   Color (the term temperature: warm or cool, and also color's hue and saturation);
-   Diffusion (hard or soft). We see diffusion in the transition between shadows and highlights. If the transition is very gradual (see the left image below), then it is soft lighting. If it's more defined and less gradual, then it is hard lighting. Lazar promises to dive deeper into this topic in the following lessons.

![Soft lighting vs hard lighting comparison](/assets/images/posts/new-mzed-course-soft-vs-hard-lighting.jpg)
*Soft lighting (on the left) vs hard lighting (on the right). Film stills from "The Ides of March" by George Clooney, 2011*

To start learning the lighting language already, you can follow this practice at least once a day. Whenever you come across an interesting lighting situation, try to describe it in the four terms, listed above.

Of course, that's only the start of the multi-faceted topic of lighting magic. Tal Lazar has an immense amount of insights to share. In "The Language of Lighting", you will also learn, for example:

-   Different methods of previsualizing lighting for better communication between the director and cinematographer, as well as between cinematographer and lighting technicians;
-   How to use reference images and define the relevant points within them;
-   When it is a good idea to use the real lighting fixtures – the so-called practicals – and when it's better to emulate them;
-   Connecting blocking and lighting, as well as procedures to successfully run a set with lighting (specifically looking at multi-camera situations);
-   Ways to measure light correctly;
-   Advanced topics such as the inverse square law, diffusion, color temperature, vectorscope, and electricity

and much more. You can read the description of all course modules [here](https://www.mzed.com/courses/the-language-of-lighting?tap_a=17272-420962&tap_s=4360246-c93b29).
