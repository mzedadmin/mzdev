For this month's giveaway, we've got a [Duken T60](https://www.dukentech.com/index/light/t60?lang=en-us), the first telescopic tube light. On March 31st, we'll randomly select a winner from the list of active MZed Pro members. The best part is there's nothing you have to do to participate in the monthly giveaway - simply be an MZed Pro member and you're automatically entered to win each month!
