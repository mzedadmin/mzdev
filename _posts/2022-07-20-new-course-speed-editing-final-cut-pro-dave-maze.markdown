One of the main attractions to Final Cut Pro is speed, but it takes some guidance to learn how to optimize your workflow for maximum efficiency. Today, we're excited to launch a brand new course on MZed: **[Speed Editing in Final Cut Pro with Dave Maze](https://www.mzed.com/courses/speed-editing-final-cut-pro)**.

[Dave Maze](https://davemaze.com/) has made a career out of being fast. Before he became a video creator, Dave was a magician who could a-maze audiences with his sleight of hand. Then, he moved on to wedding filmmaking where he turned out same-day edits that brought couples and guests to tears mere minutes after their dance floor shenanigans. And then Dave moved on to YouTube, where he hosted [Indy Mogul](https://www.youtube.com/c/indymogul) and now runs [his own very successful YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/davemaze1).

Dave has even created the most popular gif for the term "editing" and it's all about speed!

What's Dave's trick? How can you post several videos a week to YouTube, or edit client videos so quickly that you have more free time to pursue other clients or personal work?

It all comes down to cleverly using [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/), which by default is set up for quick editing, no matter what kind of video project or content you're working with. And Dave will show you his favorite hacks and techniques that will make you a quicker and more efficient editor than you would imagine.
