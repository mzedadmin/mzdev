Even if you're a rookie in marketing, there are simple steps that anyone can take to grab attention and expand their audience (or find it to begin with, in case you're just starting out). [Latasha James](https://latashajames.com/) is an entrepreneur, marketing expert, and host of "[The Freelance Friday Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUllurxaY2k4se2oLTt_JHgIiGHCe7kQm)" with thousands of listeners and viewers across different platforms. In her [MZed course "How to start a podcast"](https://www.mzed.com/courses/how-to-start-a-podcast?tap_a=17272-420962&tap_s=4271358-5ca7a1), she shares various professional insights that helped her build a large listener community. In this article, we've highlighted the most impactful and readily implementable tips. Needless to say, these tips can be transferred to any type of content that needs promoting (including videos and social media reels, for example).

One of the most important parts of promoting a podcast or video that creators tend to forget about is a captivating title. Episode (or video blog post) titles are the first thing people will see beyond the name of your show and thumbnail or cover artwork. If it doesn't speak to them, they'll keep scrolling. As a person who always needs way too much time to name her articles, I know the struggle. Yet, we want to draw in our potential listeners or viewers, so let's learn from Latasha's example.

## How to Start a Podcast

[![How to Start a Podcast](https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2023/10/MZED-How-to-start-a-podcast-300x169.jpg)](https://www.mzed.com/courses/how-to-start-a-podcast?tap_a=17272-420962&tap_s=3897887-d89a01)

So, you're interested in starting a podcast? Start here! Learn podcasting from master educator Latasha James. Planning, mastering the tech, interviewing, recording, marketing: Set yourself up for success!

In the screenshot above, you see one of Latasha's podcast episodes that performed very well in terms of clicks. As she explains, this title works for two main reasons. First, instead of just calling it "Interview with Morgan Overholt", Latasha drew the listener's attention with the massive amount of money that her guest earned on the platform [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/). Some people may not have heard of this freelance designer, but they were definitely intrigued by the "how-to" part of the title. Also, the keyword "Upwork" is something Latasha's audience finds interesting, as they often send her questions about this platform.

The second reason why such a title showcases a good example is that it does much better when it comes to SEO (or search engine optimization). Latasha James recommends adding keywords in your title that people might actually be searching for. This way, you increase the possibility that Google will show your podcast episode or video to those who really need your content.

At the same time, if we are talking about podcasts, Latasha says, it's important to hold back on your final title until you've actually recorded the episode. In most cases, the best title will be the biggest talking point from your discussion. This might be something said as an inside joke, a quote from your guest, or the most exciting fact you learned during recording.

Apart from the title, every podcast episode, video, or vlog post has something like "show notes", where you can provide a brief text description. Oftentimes, it is the last chance to make an impression on a potential listener. So, if your goal is to have a better reach for your content, thought-through show notes should be on your list of priorities.

This is what they can include, according to Latasha James:

-   A few additional talking points, delving deeper into the title topic or exploring other related areas covered in the conversation;
-   Links: either giving more information about your guests, i.e. their social media channels and products, or providing valuable data for your episode (like links to research papers, for example);
-   Transcript of the current episode. Adding it to your show notes helps to make your content more accessible to everybody, and not only those who can hear your podcast;
-   Your contact information, so it's easy to get in touch with you (both for asking questions and for possible collaborations).

With a compelling SEO-optimized title, keywords, and thorough show notes, there will be people who'll find you by searching YouTube or their favorite podcast app. However, it's only one – and at times the smallest – source from which traffic to your show may originate. According to Latasha James, using social media to expand your audience is a must nowadays.

But there are so many, you may say. How to choose the right one? Personally, I think it's always better to focus on a maximum of two or three because to maintain "all of them" will drain you of energy completely.

Latasha agrees and recommends taking a look at your listener's profile – something, that in the best case, you already established before starting a podcast or a channel. (If not, [head over here](https://www.cined.com/a-unique-podcasting-course-on-mzed-has-just-launched-learn-from-marketing-and-podcast-expert-latasha-james/) to find some tips on how to do it). Knowing who your target group is helps you to understand which social media platform to prioritize. Some common guidelines are:

Naturally, these are only general assumptions. You never really know until you test, adds Latasha.

So, ideally, when you start promoting a podcast or video on social media, you should play around with different channels and note how well your content performs on each of them.  

Something that also helps to deal with social media overload and doesn't cause much of a headache is repurposing your material. Especially if you create long-form content, it's the most efficient way to kill two birds with one stone.

One tip from Latasha James here would be to pull short clips from each long episode and share them on your social media. It's also highly recommended to customize them for every channel. For example, when your guest on a podcast talks about some business tips, take this part and upload it on LinkedIn. If your podcast discussion suddenly turned toward fashion, export some snippets for Instagram. That way, you will meet the various interests of your audience. Also, in case people follow you on different platforms, they will get fresh pieces of content from you each time they open a different app.

Another thing you can do is make a transcript of the audio and repurpose the text. One way we already talked about is to put it in your show notes for accessibility. On top of that, you can use it to create blog posts, social media captions, and an email newsletter. Nowadays, [AI tools for postproduction](https://www.cined.com/handy-ai-tools-in-postproduction-simple-ways-to-accelerate-your-workflow/) can help you with transcripts in a matter of seconds. For making an engaging newsletter, you will also need an email provider. Latasha James uses [Flodesk](https://flodesk.com/), for example.

![Flodesk email newsletter service example](/assets/images/posts/promote-podcast-or-video-flodesk-newsletter.jpg)

Don't think that newsletters are too old-fashioned. According to Latasha, they help immensely in keeping your audience on track and promoting your podcast or video further. Yet, to get there you will need an email list, and that's not always an easy type of data to gather.

Latasha James suggests creating an offer, aka a so-called lead magnet, or an opt-in. Simply put, it's a small gift that you grant in exchange for someone's email address. Of course, if your newsletter promises secret expert tips, behind-the-scenes pictures, or other special information, it might be reason enough to subscribe. However, at the beginning of your journey, you might need something else of value for your followers. That can be short e-books, online quizzes, challenges, free video classes, discounts for your products, or basically, any other interesting offer for your audience. Set it up to be sent to them automatically as soon as they sign up for a newsletter, and you're good to go.

A different strategy for promoting a podcast or video might be to form a collaboration with brands that you (and your audience) like. To do this, you should already have a following and create a well-crafted media kit. Think of it as a content creator's portfolio with visually comprehensive information about your channel. For instance, here is what Latasha James's media kit looks like:

![Media kit example showing visual statistics](/assets/images/posts/promote-podcast-or-video-media-kit-stats.jpg)

*Media kits showcase your audience and partnership opportunities to potential sponsors. Image source: CineD*

A good media kit includes key stats of the show (the number of listeners/viewers, downloads per episode, subscribers, etc.) and social media metrics that may be interesting for a brand.

Use your media kit to reach out to the companies with which you share your values, and offer them partnerships. It can be, for example, direct sponsoring (30 to 60-second ads, promoting a specific brand), or affiliate marketing. The latter brings more value to your audience because oftentimes you can offer them a discount with your affiliate link or a coupon code. At the same time, you get a small commission from each brand's sales, so it's a win-win, as Latasha explains.

Promoting a podcast or video might be a real struggle, especially if you don't like or want to invest your time and energy into it. Learning from marketing experts is a simpler way to gather or expand your audience.
