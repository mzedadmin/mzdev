There are a lot of lessons here at MZed that you can watch for free, without having to purchase a course or enrolling in an MZed Pro subscription. The only requirement is to create a login - which [you can do here](https://www.mzed.com/register). Below is an up-to-date summary of all of our freebies so you can start learning right here and now!

As a reminder, MZed does have a generous 7-day return guarantee, outlined in the [terms of service](https://www.mzed.com/terms-of-service). Essentially, you can request a refund within seven days of purchasing an MZed Pro subscription, as long as you have not watched a majority of a course. But a refund is not guaranteed, and we look at each request on a case-by-case basis to ensure a user hasn't overstepped the terms agreement.

So if you're hoping to get a free ride for a week, we don't recommend the 7-day guarantee unless you really are unsure if you plan to keep your subscription. On the other hand, these following lessons are absolutely free and you might as well watch them first if you're on the fence about MZed.

At the beginning of the 3-hour master class, [Julio Macat ASC](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531310/) discusses his philosophy on cinematography and how he got his start. Incredibly, his first feature film was _**Home Alone**_ , which went on to top box office sales for 12 weeks.

![arri julio macat master class](https://mzed-cdn1.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/news/arri-masterclass-julio-macat-asc.jpg)

In the interview, Julio recalls he was scared everyday that he was going to get fired when everyone found out he didn't know how the film would come together. He knew he had to depend on music to stitch his first feature film together, so he called up the composer who was hired to score Home Alone - someone Julio didn't know previously - and told the composer to make the music really stand out. That composer turned out to be [_the_ John Williams](https://youtu.be/yHfLyMAHrQE?t=28)!
