**UPDATE: We've increased our commitment to supporting those most in need, so we'll continue to donate 20% of all sales through the month of April also.**

There are many people who are suffering right now as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak around the world, and we're deeply saddened to hear news from our friends and extended family who are impacted.

With event cancellations and business closures shutting down a majority of film, TV, and corporate video productions, many of us in the filmmaking industry are suddenly left without work. While health is everyone's number one priority, the financial repercussions of this pandemic are still hard to stomach. The hardest hit are the less fortunate among us who were already struggling before the cancellations began. We all need to do our part to help one another through this difficult time.

**Right now, 20% of all MZed purchases will be donated to the**[**Los Angeles Regional Food Bank**](https://www.lafoodbank.org/)**.** That means that for every new MZed Pro membership you're donating $60, which equates to providing 240 meals to feed hungry children, seniors, and families. The same goes for membership renewals, and course and lesson purchases. We're planning to do this throughout March and April but possibly longer as the current situation changes day to day.

The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest district in the US, with about 600,000 students. Over 400,000 of those students rely on free and reduced-price meals. With LA schools shutting down the sad truth is that many of these kids will go hungry.

In addition to the lack of meals, school closures means many parents have to stay home from work. For some parents who are already living paycheck-to-paycheck, the Food Bank plays an essential part in meeting basic family needs.

MZed is based in Burbank, California, and with the majority of the film industry located in Los Angeles, we want to do what we can to help our neighbors and community. However, we know the coronavirus is impacting nearly everyone around the globe, so we encourage you to help where you can, locally, nationally, and around the world.

Thank you for support!
