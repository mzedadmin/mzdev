## **A New TikTok Idea Challenge**

RØDE is also asking TikTokers to share their next big idea to win $10,000 - a new category for My RØDE Reel. Here's how to do that:

• Make a TikTok that showcases your next great idea.

• Share it to TikTok with the hashtags #UnboxYourIdeas, #MyRODEReel, and #competition

• Follow [@rodemic](http://www.tiktok.com/@rodemic)

Entries can be an idea for literally anything - a film, TV show, song, podcast, dance, video game or art project. The brief is completely open.

This idea can be showcased in any way, from a pitch to camera to a full-blown demonstration. The entries will be judged on the strength of the idea, the creativity of the video, and how much judges are left wanting to know more.

The 'Unbox Your Ideas' TikTok challenge is the only category where you do not need to submit a short film and behind-the-scenes film, making it fairly easy to enter.

**Entries for the My R ØDE Reel 'Unbox Your Ideas' TikTok challenge are open now. ****Head to**[**myrodereel.com/tiktok**](http://myrodereel.com/tiktok)**to find out more.  **
