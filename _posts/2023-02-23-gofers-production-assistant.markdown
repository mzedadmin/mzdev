There are endless books about directing movies, but it's rare to see a dedicated guide for film crews. "[Gofers: On the Front Lines of Film and Television](https://www.passingplanes.com/book)" is a new book that is entirely focused on the production assistant role in the film industry. And because of how specific it is, every line in the book becomes precious advice for any up and coming PA.

The author of the book, [Daniel Scarpati](https://www.passingplanes.com/about), is a New York-based filmmaker and camera operator. He graduated from CUNY Macaulay Honors College at Brooklyn College before jumping into a career as a production assistant. His insight into the PA job is all too familiar for anyone who already works as a PA, but for anyone on the cusp of joining the film industry, this book should be required reading.

## Interview with Daniel Scarpati about "Gofers: On the Front Lines of Film and Television"

### Q: What's a Gofer?

**A:** My favorite definition has always been the Oxford English Dictionary's: "A person who runs errands, especially on a film set or in an office." It really shines the spotlight at those breaking into showbiz!

For about six years, I worked as a film/TV production assistant, or "PA" for short. These are interchangeable terms: PAs and gofers both refer to the people, oftentimes the youngest and lowest paid crew members, who are sent on an endless variety of errands for those higher up in the film set hierarchy.

### Q: What inspired you to write Gofers?

**A:** I was a connection-less kid from Queens, New York with no knowledge of how to break into the industry before I began PA'ing. As I found my first jobs and began sharing stories from set with classmates and at college open houses, I kept hearing the same questions: "What does a PA do?" "How do you start out, and what's it like going from gig to gig?" "What are the best and worst things that have happened to you on set?"

I repeated the same answers enough times that I thought it'd be infinitely more helpful if I could point people to one definitive well of knowledge. No book I knew of at the time covered all the industries of single-camera and multi-camera film/TV, commercials, and new media/streaming. So I decided to write the book I wish existed back when I was starting out.

### Q: What's a typical career path – how does a Production Assistant get started in the business?

**A:** In the beginning, PAs generally work as an "additional," or on a daily basis. They are needed on set, in the production office, and sometimes in specific departments (camera, wardrobe, etc.). There were weeks when I worked on a different set every day. If you're like I was and have trouble memorizing people's names, you learn very quickly how to do that well!

Knowing someone's title, rank in their department and personality type can make all the difference when hours grow long—and they will. The average length of a workday is 12 hours. Showcase your efforts to enough people and it doesn't take long to be offered a staff position. Staff PAs are hired for full-time positions and follow a chain of command that looks something like this:

"AD" stands for assistant director, the next rank up for many set PAs. These crew members are second-in-command under the director and production manager. They schedule the entire production and hire PAs, so they're good people to know as you start out.

### Q: What don't they teach you in film school about crewing on a production?

**A:** I can't believe film schools don't offer classes about freelancing, which is a time-consuming lifestyle. Understanding how (and more importantly, why) to keep records of jobs you've been employed on; curate your own schedule; manage money and begin saving for retirement; which receipts you might use as tax write-offs; and what streams of passive income you might consider creating for time periods where your phone isn't ringing. No matter which department a person works in, we all have these same considerations day-to-day.

### Q: How can a Production Assistant avoid burnout?

**A:** Regardless of the type of productions a PA might specialize in, burnout can feel inevitable. In most parts of the world, this is a non-union, minimum-wage job with a high rate of turnover. Those in charge of PAs aren't always patient with the people who fail to quickly catch on to the daily grind.

As I ranked up from additional to staff Production Assistant, hours grew even longer. Friday nights turned into Saturday mornings (a "Fraturday") and weekends passed after a few hours of sleep. From time to time, give yourself a break. Promise yourself time off after a certain amount of work weeks, and stick to your word. Listen to your body and consider taking up exercises like stretching and core workouts – assuming your doctor approves. If you need more sleep, don't be afraid to speak up to your supervisor. Physical and emotional wellness shouldn't be kicked to the curb.

### Q: What surprised you most about working as a PA?

**A:** The variety of tasks was surprising. One day you might be managing craft services, the next you're coordinating with local authorities for permits, and the day after that you're helping with equipment transport. The role teaches you every aspect of production, which is invaluable for anyone looking to advance in the industry.

### Q: What advice would you give to someone considering a PA role?

**A:** First, understand that it's physically and mentally demanding work. But it's also the best film school you can get. You'll work alongside experienced professionals in every department, learning how productions actually function from the ground up. Be prepared to work long hours, but also be excited about the networking opportunities and hands-on education you'll receive.

## Essential skills for Production Assistants

Based on Daniel's experience and the insights in his book, here are key skills every PA should develop:

**Communication:** Clear, concise communication is crucial when coordinating between departments and relaying information up and down the chain of command.

**Organization:** Managing multiple tasks, schedules, and information requires strong organizational skills and attention to detail.

**Problem-solving:** PAs often need to find quick solutions to unexpected challenges that arise during production.

**Physical stamina:** Long days on set require physical endurance and the ability to stay alert during extended shoots.

**Adaptability:** Every production is different, and PAs must be able to adapt quickly to new environments, crews, and workflows.

## Building your career beyond PA

Daniel's career progression from PA to camera operator demonstrates the possibilities for advancement. Here are common career paths:

**Assistant Director track:** Many PAs advance to become 2nd ADs, then 1st ADs, eventually becoming Unit Production Managers or Directors.

**Department specialization:** PAs can transition into specific departments like camera, sound, or post-production.

**Production coordination:** Moving into production office roles like production coordinator or production manager.

**Creative roles:** Some PAs use their on-set experience to transition into writing, directing, or producing.
