title: Gifts for Filmmakers and Film Students
---

Looking for a last-minute gift for a filmmaker or film student in your life? You'd think buying a piece of gear is the best option, but you have about 1 in 10 million chances of picking the exact thing that they actually need or want. That's why investing in education is a safe bet - with the MZed Pro Membership you get full access to the leading online education platform with over 50 courses.

The old adage about gift giving says to give something the recipient really wants but probably wouldn't get themself. And let's be honest, filmmakers are notorious for not spending money on important things to fuel their growth.

But, why is that? Why would young filmmakers not invest in their own education, self-improvement, and in career growth? Isn't the goal to eventually make this into a full-time job that doesn't feel like a job?

Sure. But in the meantime, a beautiful cinema lens feels so much more exciting, desirable, and full of possibilities than boring ol' education and knowledge. Or that new drone, gimbal, and especially a new bag. Everyone loves a new bag. Think of all those photography walkabouts you'll be going on now that you have a new bag.

This is precisely the thought process filmmakers go through when they buy something new. And it's exactly why you should do them a favor and give them something that is actually going to impact their career and lifelong passion - the gift of filmmaking education.

## Education is the Best Gift for Film Students and Filmmakers

For this gift idea, you don't need to run to the store or pay for super expensive overnight express shipping. You can purchase it in seconds, and the recipient can start browsing through courses immediately. How much easier can it get? Here's the link to purchase an MZed Pro gift membership.

So, what does the membership entail? Nearly 400 hours of education from the best and most well-known instructors in the industry. The workshops and courses available are from leading professionals in their field and if purchased individually they would cost over $9,000 altogether. MZed has licensed them all into a simple 12-month bundle for $30/month, billed annually at $349.

And when you give MZed Pro as a gift for filmmakers, you get to choose the date the recipient receives the e-mail with their gift. Want it to arrive on Christmas Day? Sure thing. Prefer to give on New Year's Day - as a New Year's Resolution to help them level up as a filmmaker? No problem.

## **Offline Learning is a Gift in An Over Connected World**

But how can you ensure your film student will actually take advantage of the gift membership? What if the constant lure of the world wide web foils their plans to watch the nearly 400 hours of education on MZed?

Luckily, we have an iOS app that allows MZed Pro members to watch all of our courses offline on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod, which you probably gifted them back in 2012 and can now remind them about it. The app also works on Silicon Macs, by the way, so offline viewing on an M1 Macbook Air works just as well as on an iOS device ([here's how](https://www.mzed.com/news/apple-silicon-mac-sideload-mzed-app)).

## **MZed Pro is the perfect gift for filmmakers**

Sure, a brand-new mirrorless camera could convince your film student to get out of the house and start telling stories with moving images. Still, it's not going to teach them how to make a career out of traveling documentaries ([this course, however, will](https://www.mzed.com/courses/adventure-filmmaking-russ-malkin)).

Before you buy another battery-powered gizmo, take a moment to think about what gift you had liked to receive while growing up. Gadgets? Toys? Candy? Or lifelong confidence-boosting, career-making education? Probably gadgets. But that's because MZed Pro wasn't around when you were growing up.

So stop what you're doing right now and get this MZed Pro membership gift for that special filmmaker or film student in your life. In a year's time, they'll be talking about story arcs and film grain, which is way more fun to talk about than camera megapixels and bitrates.
