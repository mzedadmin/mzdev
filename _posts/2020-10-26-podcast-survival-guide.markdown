[Cinema Sound](https://www.mzed.com/courses/cinema-sound) is already the most thorough course on audio production, with over 86 hours of hands-on tutorials, but now there is a new addition to the course that makes it even more essential viewing for students of audio production.

Designed to be watched as an addendum to the comprehensive Cinema Sound course, the new "Podcaster Survival Guide" covers everything that podcast producers and creatives need to know about how to record, edit, fix and deliver a professional and compliant podcast.
