title: Choosing the Right Timelapse Interval

If photography and video had a child, it would be a timelapse. You get the best of both worlds: framing up an amazing photo, and then creating a moving visual feast out of a few thousand of those photos. But there are some important technical details that are necessary for getting a great timelapse, and one of them is choosing the timelapse interval setting.

For Drew Geraci, timelapse started out as a hobby, a fun addition to photography and video production work. But as he describes it, "once you start getting into it, you really have to get into it, because there's a lot of time that's involved in it."

Luckily the gear and workflows that make cinematic timelapse possible are way more newbie-friendly now than they were years ago. And you also have the benefit of Drew's new course on MZed, [Cinematic Timelapse](https://www.mzed.com/courses/cinematic-timelapse-drew-geraci), to guide you through the process step by step.

There is a wealth of information in Drew's course, from setting up gear to scouting a location, all the way to the best post production workflows. But as a little teaser for the course, here's a few tips from Drew on choosing the right interval for your timelapse subject.

## How to choose a timelapse interval

One of the first questions to ask yourself is how long you plan to shoot your timelapse, and what is your primary subject. For example, are you wanting to show clouds moving, or shadows on a building as the light changes? Or maybe a crowd of people in a busy downtown park? Or maybe you want to show a night scene full of cars, next to another timelapse of a cityscape transitioning from night to day?

The amount of time you estimate that you'll need to complete a timelapse is essential to knowing your interval setting. If you plan to shoot for 4 hours, you'll have an entirely different interval setting than if you plan to shoot a long timelapse over 1-2 years, for example. In general, the less time you have, the shorter the interval. And the slower the movement happening in the frame, the longer the interval.

One thing to note is that Drew recommends you match your interval setting with your shutter speed. So if you have a 1-second interval, you want to get your shutter speed to as close to 1 second as possible, but not over. The interval determines the time from the start of one exposure to the start of the next exposure, so you want to make sure the shutter speed matches that interval duration while keeping the shutter speed less than the interval.

And of course, you have to think about your overall light availability. If you're shooting a dark scene, you'll need a longer shutter speed, which means you'll also need to choose a longer interval setting.

With that said, here are some of Drew's favorite interval settings for timelapse.

## Timelapse Interval setting for a short timelapse

If you only have 15-20 minutes to shoot a timelapse, an interval of 1-2 seconds is recommended, and 4-5 seconds if you plan to stick around for 1-2 hours. That could be enough to capture some dramatic cloud movement or people and cars in a busy intersection. The goal is to give your timelapse enough images to create a timelapse video even if you're only shooting for a short period of time.

Drew also notes that your interval setting is also dependent on your lens focal length. If you're shooting with a wide-angle lens, you will want a faster interval length, and if you're shooting with a telephoto, you'll want to shoot for maybe a 3-4 second interval length.

## Fog timelapse interval setting

For shooting fog, Drew says you want to use the fastest interval that you have on your camera or intervalometer. 1 second is good, but 1/2 second is even better. That way you'll ensure a buttery smooth, water-like effect with moving fog.

## Intervals for People and Cars

If you set an interval too slow for a people-based timelapse, you may not see enough movement in the frame to illustrate what is happening. So [Drew recommends](https://www.mzed.com/courses/cinematic-timelapse-drew-geraci) 1-second or 1/2-second intervals, with the shutter speed to match. That way you'll be able to see people's actions are visible without too much blur.

With cars at night, 2-3 second intervals are recommended to create beautiful, long light streaks that give your shot a vibe that only a timelapse video can provide. During the day, Drew recommends 1-2 second intervals, since you don't have the light streaks and you want to ensure the cars aren't too blurred.

## Shadows during Winter and Summer

According to Drew, shadows can be tough because they move so slowly. During winter months, when the sun is lower in the sky, shadows move much faster than during summer months. In winter, Drew recommends 30-60 second intervals, while summer shadow timelapses might need 2-5 minute intervals to show meaningful change.

The key with shadow timelapses is patience – you'll typically need to shoot for several hours to capture compelling movement.

## Construction and Long-term Timelapses

For construction projects or other long-term subjects that change over weeks, months, or even years, the intervals become much longer:

**Daily intervals:** For construction projects, you might shoot one frame per day at the same time each day. This creates fascinating documentation of progress over time.

**Weekly or monthly intervals:** For seasonal changes, plant growth, or other very slow processes, you might only capture images weekly or monthly.

**Seasonal projects:** Some of the most compelling timelapses show the same location through different seasons, requiring consistent shooting over an entire year.

## Technical Considerations for Different Intervals

**Battery life:** Shorter intervals drain batteries faster. Plan accordingly with extra batteries or external power sources.

**Storage space:** More frequent intervals mean more images and larger file sizes. Ensure you have adequate storage.

**Camera settings:** Consider using manual mode to maintain consistent exposure across your sequence, especially for longer projects where lighting conditions might change.

**Stability:** Longer projects require more robust mounting solutions to prevent camera movement over time.

## Post-Production Considerations

The interval you choose affects your post-production workflow:

**Frame rate conversion:** Consider what frame rate you want for your final video. Standard video is 24, 25, or 30fps, so plan your intervals accordingly.

**Smoothing and deflickering:** Longer intervals between shots can create more variation in exposure that needs correction in post.

**Speed ramping:** Some projects benefit from variable intervals – starting slow and speeding up, or vice versa.

## Weather and Environmental Factors

Environmental conditions significantly impact your interval choices:

**Wind:** Strong winds can cause camera shake between frames, especially problematic with shorter intervals.

**Temperature changes:** Extreme temperature variations can affect camera performance and battery life.

**Precipitation:** Rain or snow requires weather protection and might affect your planned shooting duration.
