## **ASC Educational Content on MZed**

  
As a first step of the cooperation, MZed  will start offering ASC video content, such as conversations with world-renowned cinematographers like Phedon Papamichael, ASC, Hoyte van Hoytema, ASC, Polly Morgan, ASC, Checco Varese, ASC, and many others. In these videos the world-renowned cinematographers share their inspirations and experiences while analyzing their work and creative processes. This content will be updated consistently.

## **Next: ASC Wildlife Filmmaking & Interview Lighting Workshops - Exclusively on MZed**

  
During this year's [Jackson Wild Summit](https://www.jacksonwild.org/) held in a natural reserve in Austria, the American Society of Cinematographers hosted a Wildlife Filmmaking workshop as well as a Lighting workshop. Paul Atkins, ASC, one of the most renowned wildlife cinematographers in the world, and Stephen Lighthill, ASC (President of the ASC), hosted three days of hands-on workshops to up-and-coming wildlife filmmakers from all over the world, with a particular emphasis on Africa and Asia. CineD video producers captured both workshops and will release them on MZed as online courses in the coming months. 

In conjunction with the ASC and Jackson Wild, MZed will make the Wildlife Filmmaking workshop available free of charge to filmmaking students and professionals around the world. The ASC Interview Lighting workshop will be available as part of the MZed Pro filmmaking education subscription and as a separate purchase.

## **Fostering education about cinematography**

  
"_The ASC is delighted to share some of its educational content with MZed, to further expand our outreach to cinematographers and film students around the world_ ", says ASC President Stephen Lighthill, ASC.  "_Education is the core mission of the ASC_ ".

"_MZed, CineD, and The ASC all share a unified mission to educate filmmakers from all corners of our industry,_ " says MZed manager Slavik Boyechko. "_I am thrilled because this partnership means more filmmakers around the world will now have access to the wisdom and guidance of The ASC 's legendary cinematographers_."

CineD's Co-CEO Nino Leitner, AAC says, "_For many of us, ASC members are the cinematography heroes we look up to. As Terry McCarthy has pointed out to me before, there 's no craft in filmmaking that has more comradery amongst their peers than cinematography. I'll add that there's also no organization with more history and experience in cinematography and more dedication towards the progression of the art of cinematography than the American Society of Cinematographers. We are incredibly humbled to partner with the ASC. ASC members are the cinematography heroes we have looked up to our entire lives, and their work for me is also the reason why I do what I do. The CineD and MZed community of lifetime learners will now be able to learn from the very best cinematographers in the world_."
