What makes a filmmaker credible? What about a filmmaking educator? Is it experience on a feature film set, or a TV series, or a documentary film? Is it experience teaching others? Or is any of that relevant anymore?

A couple years ago when we were looking through ideas for new courses, we considered the usual avenue for educators. That meant seeking out filmmakers who have the professional background to support what they're teaching. And that meant a resume with film or TV productions, ideally titles that are recognizable and celebrated for their achievements. After all, we want to learn from the masters of our craft, right?

But today our world is vastly different than even a couple years ago. Today, it's safe to say the majority of up-and-coming filmmakers are not going to traditional film school, and they're not yearning to become crew members on a Hollywood feature film production. They want to become YouTubers.

In fact, becoming a YouTuber has now become the dream for every child around the planet. So long astronauts, presidents, doctors and lawyers.

But being a YouTuber doesn't just mean vlogging and gear reviews. Every style of filmmaking has reached YouTube, from narrative features, to comedy series, short films, documentaries, animations, travel and cooking, soap operas, game shows, and more.

The difference between aspiring to become a YouTube filmmaker versus the traditional career pathways is simple: there are no barriers on YouTube. Anyone can get started, all you have to do is begin.
