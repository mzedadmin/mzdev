title: ASC Master Class is Highly Recommended
---

The ASC (The American Society of Cinematographers) has been putting on [its in-person master class courses](https://theasc.com/asc/education/master-class) for a long time. In fact, part of its core mission is to provide continuous learning opportunities for both its members and the greater filmmaking community. On top of the education, participants are able to network and brush shoulders with some of the greatest cinematographers in filmmaking history.

When the pandemic halted in-person classes and meetups, ASC members did exactly what cinematographers do best: they adapted to the situation, they used every available resource they had, and they kept the show going.

So in place of the Los Angeles-based master classes, [ASC is now offering remote, online classes](https://store.ascmag.com/collections/master-classes/products/asc-online-master-class-january-22-24-2020) to anyone in the world. In some ways, this is almost a blessing in disguise, because now just about anyone can take advantage of this incredible opportunity to learn from master DPs.

 

## **What Is Included in an ASC Master Class?**

The beauty of the ASC master classes are the opportunities to connect in a live setting with other cinematographers, both veteran filmmakers as well as other students. In this industry, face time is an invaluable part of developing your skills, connections, and opportunities to further engage. 

Many of the courses here at MZed actually came from in-person workshops, such as [Vincent Laforet's Direction Motion](/courses/vincent-laforet-directing-motion), and [Alex Buono's Art of Visual Storytelling](/courses/art-of-visual-storytelling/) and [Visual Storytelling 2](/courses/visual-storytelling-2). We know how important these workshops are, which is why we're so grateful that ASC is continuing to invest in live learning, even during this difficult year. It's not easy to get together some of the most well-known cinematographers together at the same time, along with 30 students from around the world.

For the online master classes, ASC puts on three days of live seminars, with live interactions and Q&A interviews, film critiques and discussions, and pre-recorded lighting demonstrations. Each day you can expect to be actively participating along with the other classmates, so you can't just sit in the back of the class - or in this case, turn off your video stream - and tune out.

Each class has a cap for the number of participants, to keep the class size small and let everyone have an opportunity to engage. The classes have been selling out steadily, so if you're interested in attending, don't wait until the last minute to register.

In addition to the students, a very generous number of ASC members join the class throughout the three-day online workshop. It's really a treat to be able to converse with cinematographers who have worked on some of the most iconic films in history. To us filmmakers, these are our heroes, which makes it so special to be able to learn directly from them, no matter where you are in the world.

## **ASC Master Class in January 2021**

The next ASC master class is happening January 22-24, 2021. Some of the instructors will be [Fred Elmes](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005695/), cinematographer for some classic independent films such as _Blue Velvet_ , _Wild at Heart_ , _Night on Earth_ , and _Coffee and Cigarettes_.

[Bob Yeoman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005934/) will also be instructing, and you may know him as the director of photography for Wes Anderson's films. And [Tobias Schliessler](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005859), who filmed Beauty and the Beast, Dreamgirls, and Friday Night Lights, will be one of the teachers. And keep in mind many other ASC members join in with interviews and Q&A throughout the course.
