**The 2023 NAB Show is just around the corner and CineD is keeping up the tradition of bringing you the latest and greatest directly from the show floor! From April 16th to 19th, we will not only be interviewing the biggest names in our industry but this time we are even presented with our own booth.**

As the first major industry international tradeshow for 2023 will take place in Las Vegas in just under two weeks, we want to share what to expect during this very busy and exciting time for our filming industry with our audience.

Being closer to you guys, our audience, and searching for ways to personally connect with you brought us to start something completely new for us â€“ for the first time during IBC 2022, we had our booth. As this engagement was very successful and inspiring for us, we decided to do the same during NAB 2023.

For the last 13 years, CineD has reported all the important gear news from NAB in Las Vegas (and IBC in Amsterdam, for that matter) and we didn't miss a single show. Of course, we will be there again this year with a dedicated 7-person team shooting and editing videos about new gear, and writing articles around them too. But we're not stopping there. 

For the **first time** and together with FUJIFILM, we will practice a ["Camera to Cloud" workflow.](https://www.cined.com/fujifilm-x-h2s-camera-to-cloud-explained/) Yes, we are aware that C2C might be considered by some production houses and camera crews as something that "sounds interesting", but in reality, many ask themselves, what they are supposed to do with it. Is it expensive to implement? Is it practical? What are the benefits (and shortcomings) of working in this way? Well, we are asking ourselves the same and that's why, we decided to jump on the bandwagon by collaborating with FUJIFILM and exploring this new workflow territory for ourselves.

For that matter, FUJIFILM will provide us with the infrastructure, such as a fast internet connection and a dedicated frame.io account, including X-H2 and X-H2S cameras with some accessories to cover the show. In addition, we decided also to create a mini-documentary that will be published after the show is over. Hopefully, our findings and impressions can be of help to anyone who is considering adopting a "Camera to Cloud" workflow in newsgathering or live events.

CineD booth #C5150

The CineD stand at the 2023 NAB Show serves several purposes: the most important one, of course, connecting with you, our dear audience. We are proud to be in the main exhibition hall with distinguished companies from our industry.

Come by for a (free) coffee, and a chat. Oh, and also, for our die-hard fans, if you let us scan you to stay in touch, we will give you a cool keychain.
