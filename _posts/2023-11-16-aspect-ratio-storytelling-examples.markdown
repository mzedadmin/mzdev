title: Storytelling with Aspect Ratios
---

"What aspect ratio will fit here?" When you start a new film or video project, that question would (or should) be among the first you ask in preproduction. Of course, you can always stick with the go-to 16:9 format. However, why not explore alternative options that go beyond the norm? Aspect ratio isn't just about framing your images and taking advantage of a specific screen size. Over time, filmmakers have started to use aspect ratio as a storytelling tool or to create a specific visual atmosphere. In this article, we'll take a look at some strong examples of films that utilize these techniques, and talk about ways you can apply them in your own projects.

Let me emphasize that visual components within a frame, such as [headroom](https://www.cined.com/the-art-of-imbalance-exploring-the-impact-of-headroom-in-storytelling/), [leading lines](https://www.cined.com/using-lines-in-shot-composition-a-journey-of-visual-mastery-with-film-examples/), and even [the art of camera movement](https://www.cined.com/how-to-create-a-suspenseful-long-take-with-movie-tv-scene-examples/)–do not occur merely by chance. It's something that requires careful composition and planning to make it work and reveal true craft. The same applies to aspect ratio. You may argue that the video production industry doesn't often leave us a choice with all the technical delivery requirements and additional snippets for Instagram reels. Well, even in that case, there are a couple of tricks that can be inspirational for your content.

## The history of aspect ratio

Let's get back to basics. Needless to say, we haven't always had a variety of aspect ratios to choose from. Do you know how the most common 16:9 (or 1.77, to be more formal) entered the game in the first place? Cinematographer [Alex Buono](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0120645/) explains the whole format evolution in his [MZed-course "Art of Visual Storytelling"](https://www.mzed.com/courses/art-of-visual-storytelling) with a blend of clarity and an entertaining style.

History takes us all way back to 1892 when George Eastman gave Thomas Edison a roll of 35-millimeter wide film, leading to the creation of a frame that was four perforations tall. The interior image measured 18 by 25mm (equivalent to a 1.33 aspect ratio), and this remained the universal film standard for years. With the advent of sound in 1932, the frame suddenly had to accommodate an optical soundtrack as well, which reduced the inside picture size bringing the aspect ratio to 1.37 (commonly known as the "Academy Ratio").

But the famous "box" (1.33, or as we often refer to it–4:3) didn't die out. When television was invented, it adopted the beloved format and gave it new life. Now, filmmakers were concerned about how to bring people back to movie theatres. So, in 1953, Paramount created a 1.66 widescreen format, starting a new boom in development. The screen got wider and wider, reaching up to absolutely insane aspect ratios, like MGM65 2.76, in which the movie "[Ben-Hur](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052618/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_Ben%2520Hur)" was shot.

This unmanageable expansion of the screen stabilized with the increasing reliability of anamorphic lenses. Nowadays, we have two scope standards: an anamorphic with a 2.35 aspect ratio, and a "flat" 1.85 widescreen (used for filming with spherical lenses).

What about 16:9 then? Well, as technology advanced, some engineers opted to create a new format for television. In dealing with the fact that some filmmakers still liked the square frame and others utilized the whole anamorphic scope, the new aspect ratio needed to cater to both choices without distorting the image. So, as you see in the illustration below, they basically drew a frame around the whole thing and called it "high definition".

![How 16:9 aspect ratio was created](/assets/images/posts/aspect-ratio-storytelling-16-9-invention.jpg)

If you're ever in doubt or want to choose an aspect ratio based on pure logistics, go for 16:9. It won't let you down as it's compatible with most standard HD televisions and monitors. However, if you're up to trying something different, let's look at several options.

## 4:3 aspect ratio as a storytelling tool

First, a specific aspect ratio can become a time machine in your film, paying tribute to a particular period or filmmaking phase. Let's take 4:3. Historically, the box was associated with a television format. Also, some viewers might feel slightly nostalgic looking at this aspect ratio because the earliest movies used it as well. So, if you want to evoke this emotional response, consider 1.33 as your format. You can also play with history as [Wes Anderson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_Wes%2520Anderson) does in his "[The Grand Budapest Hotel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_The%2520Grand%2520Budapest%2520Hotel)". For example, take a look at the three film stills below. All of these scenes take place in different periods (1932, 1968, and the 1980s), so the director uses various aspect ratios, which were common at each specific time.

![The Grand Budapest Hotel 4:3 aspect ratio](/assets/images/posts/aspect-ratio-storytelling-grand-budapest-4-3.jpg)

Another reason why a filmmaker might choose an almost square 1.33 aspect ratio lies in the story they want to tell. If your film follows a personal and deeply emotional story, 4:3 might be a wise choice. Why? Because it's an absolutely gorgeous format to frame faces. When you opt for middle shots or close-ups, the head of your character will fill out a big part of the screen compared to, say, a classic cinemascope with a lot of empty space on the side. It's only logical, right?

As we know from other [film theory lessons](https://www.cined.com/learning-the-camera-language-tips-on-the-fundamentals-of-directing/), close-ups of faces are a great way to connect viewers to your character emotionally, without words. For example, here are some stills from "[American Honey](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3721936/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_American%2520Honey)", a road drama from 2016 shot in 4:3. This film tells the story of a young girl, Star, from a troubled family, who runs away with a traveling sales crew and goes through different challenges of youth and growing up.

![American Honey 4:3 intimate framing](/assets/images/posts/aspect-ratio-storytelling-american-honey.jpg)

The square-ish format forces the viewer to focus on Star's face and expressions, creating an intimate connection that might be lost in a wider frame. Director Andrea Arnold's choice of 4:3 supports the film's themes of youth, vulnerability, and personal discovery.

## Scope formats for epic storytelling

On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have ultra-wide formats like 2.35:1 and 2.39:1. These scope formats are ideal for:

**Epic landscapes:** Wide vistas, sweeping horizons, and grand scale environments.

**Action sequences:** Car chases, battle scenes, and dynamic movement across the frame.

**Ensemble scenes:** Multiple characters sharing the frame in complex blocking.

**Architectural grandeur:** Showcasing impressive buildings, interiors, and designed spaces.

The scope format creates a sense of cinematic grandeur and can make even intimate scenes feel more theatrical and important. However, it requires careful composition to avoid leaving too much empty space in the frame.

## Changing aspect ratios within a single film

Some filmmakers take the bold step of changing aspect ratios within a single film to enhance storytelling. This technique can:

**Indicate flashbacks or different time periods:** Like Anderson's approach in The Grand Budapest Hotel.

**Show character perspective:** Wider ratios for external world, narrower for internal thoughts.

**Build tension:** Gradually changing from wide to narrow as tension increases.

**Separate reality from fantasy:** Different ratios for different narrative layers.

**Examples of films using multiple aspect ratios:**

- **The Grand Budapest Hotel:** Uses three different ratios for three time periods
- **Mommy:** Switches from 1:1 to scope to show emotional liberation
- **The Dark Knight:** IMAX sequences in 1.43:1, regular scenes in 2.39:1
- **First Man:** Various ratios to show different spacecraft environments

## Practical considerations for different aspect ratios

When choosing an aspect ratio for your project, consider:

### Technical factors:

**Distribution requirements:** What platforms will show your film?

**Equipment limitations:** Do your cameras support the desired ratio natively?

**Post-production workflow:** How will you handle different ratios in editing?

**Exhibition venues:** Movie theaters, streaming, television, mobile devices?

### Creative factors:

**Story themes:** Intimate vs. epic, personal vs. universal

**Character focus:** Single protagonist vs. ensemble cast

**Visual style:** Realistic vs. stylized, modern vs. period

**Genre conventions:** What do audiences expect from your genre?

## Aspect ratio in the digital age

Modern filmmaking offers unprecedented flexibility in aspect ratios:

**Variable aspect ratios:** Some cameras can record multiple ratios simultaneously

**Digital mastering:** Easy to create different versions for different platforms

**Streaming platforms:** Growing acceptance of non-standard ratios

**Mobile consumption:** Vertical video becoming more accepted

**Social media:** Square formats gaining popularity for specific content

## Working with aspect ratios in post-production

### Planning considerations:

**Shoot wider than your final ratio:** This allows for reframing in post

**Consider multiple deliverables:** Plan for different versions early

**Graphics and titles:** Design elements that work across different ratios

**Color grading:** Different ratios may require different approaches

### Technical workflow:

**Timeline settings:** Set up your editing system for multiple ratios

**Export considerations:** Different ratios for different platforms

**Quality control:** Ensure proper framing across all deliverables

**Archive formats:** Plan for future flexibility

## Audience psychology and aspect ratios

Different aspect ratios create different psychological responses in viewers:

**4:3 feels intimate and nostalgic:** Viewers associate it with older films and TV

**16:9 feels neutral and familiar:** The standard that doesn't draw attention to itself

**Scope feels cinematic and grand:** Associated with big-budget, theatrical experiences

**Vertical feels modern and personal:** Associated with mobile-first content

**Square feels artistic and crafted:** Instagram has made this feel curated and intentional
