## Lighting People – On Location

[![Lighting People – On Location](/assets/images/posts/new-course-lighting-people-hero.jpg)](https://www.mzed.com/courses/lighting-people-on-location?tap_a=17272-420962&tap_s=3897887-d89a01)

In this practical 4-hour workshop, master cinematographers Paul Atkins, ASC, and Stephen Lighthill, ASC, share tips and tricks on how to achieve naturally looking lighting on location, both outdoors and indoors, in front of a diverse audience of filmmakers from all over the world.

## Lighting People – On Location by the ASC: lesson overview

### Lesson 1 – Indoor Lighting with Paul Atkins, ASC

In Lesson 1, [Paul Atkins, ASC](https://paulatkins.com/), one of the most renowned wildlife cinematographers in the world, teaches indoor on-location lighting of people to a diverse group of young filmmakers. He talks about camera angles and positioning, catchlights, the direction of the light, and achieving lighting that is natural looking, depending on your location. He experiments with the positioning of the key light and how it changes the look of the subject in front of the camera, including how shadows fall. Paul talks about big light sources vs. small ones and shows the effect of reflecting surfaces as well as spill light, how to control it with black floppies, and so much more. At the end of the session, he answers lots of student questions on lighting and shooting interviews.

### Lesson 2 – Outdoor Lighting with Paul Atkins, ASC

In Lesson 2, Paul Atkins, ASC, transfers what he taught in Lesson 1 into a very simple and everyday outdoor situation during harsh sunlight. He deals with getting an acceptable image and explains why he recommends always shooting into the sun outdoors. Paul touches on how to adjust for various skin tones in outdoor lighting, and how to get more contrast even on light skin tones when the sun is out. In conversation with the students, they delve into adapting to overcast conditions and adjusting the setup accordingly. The significance of maintaining catchlights is highlighted, and guidance is provided on achieving it in various situations. Diffusing sunlight is shown in practice with frames and diffusion. The students ask practical questions about documentary shooting outdoors – how to shoot interviews on a boat, for example. Paul also goes into practical considerations like choosing the right time of day for an interview, the right location, the right clothing for interviewees, and so on. Lighting is also creating shade when needed to create contrast, especially outside, and using reflectors to create a natural-looking image without artificial light (or as a fill light).

### Lesson 3 – Indoor Lighting with Stephen Lighthill, ASC

In his first indoor lighting session of the workshop, master cinematographer and [former ASC president Stephen Lighthill, ASC](https://theasc.com/blog/author/StephenLighthillASC), challenges the students to tell him what their plan is to light a room and then gives his comments to the suggestions. He talks about the problem of working under existing fluorescent tubes in a room when you are shooting an interview on location, and how to manage different circumstances – lights you can swap vs. lights you have to live with and how you can modify their look. Stephen talks about how to tackle different challenges when working with windows – in-shot and off-shot. They talk about working with multiple cameras in an interview and what compromises that would mean for the lighting setup. They run through various focal lengths and show the different effects they have on the face in front of the camera in combination with the lighting. Towards the end of the lesson, Stephen shows how to light a setup at a bar.

### Lesson 4 – Outdoor Lighting with Stephen Lighthill, ASC

In his outdoor lesson, Stephen starts by advising the students to look at the direction the sun is moving and plan for that. He then proceeds to talk about the sweet spot of various lenses and how to find it – and what not to do with them. Stephen shares his rule of thumb that you should reflect the key light to get a natural-looking fill light. He talks about the importance of catchlights and shows his favorite positioning of a key light – in this case, a large white bounce board. They then swap to a strong LED light and show how easily a portrait shot will look "lit" outside if not used correctly. Stephen talks about the importance of consistency in lighting, framing, and lens selection within one production and much more.
