In this hour-long session Tal Lazar will take a deep-dive into the type of preparation a director does in order to initiate a successful collaboration with a cinematographer. The event will cover:

**\- What in the script is used to create images?  
\- What does a cinematographer require to begin a creative collaboration with a director?  
\- What is the role of the director when working with a cinematographer, and how to lead a creative conversation without needing much technical knowledge?  
\- And more!**  
 

MZed Pro members will receive an email with instructions on how to join.
