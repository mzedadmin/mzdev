[**Filmmaking for Photographers**](https://www.mzed.com/courses/filmmaking-for-photographers) is a course that Philip has dreamed of creating for a long time, after watching many photographers attempt to move into the video world.

The course is relevant for both photographers and filmmakers who want to learn about camera movement and sequences, lighting styles and challenges, story and narrative, and much more. It's over seven hours of education that eloquently weave hundreds of lessons Philip has learned along his filmmaking journey.

## The Filmmaking for Photographers Course

Production of "Filmmaking for Photographers" took over a year from start to finish, utilizing a large crew in one of the most exquisite sets for a course yet. Needless to say, this was on of our most elaborate productions at MZed and we're incredibly proud of the results.

> _" It's hard to come up with a superlative that doesn't sound like a cliche. Superb. Brilliant. Awesome. You get the idea. This is an excellent course, taught by an exceptional filmmaker and teacher. Highly recommended." \- Marshall Cant_

To really illustrate the vast variety of filmmaking style and approaches, instructor Philip Bloom brings the viewer along with him on different shooting scenarios and challenges. At a large castle, he shows how to move the camera purposefully to push a story forward.

Later at a beachouse, an unexpected storm presents an opportunity to teach filmmakers how to stay nimble and flexible when shooting conditions change.

To bring all of the storytelling lessons home, Philip dedicates two hours to the post-production part of filmmaking. He takes us through the preparation and organization stage, to editing pace and style, to audio, music, as well as color grading. We see tips and methods here that Philip has honed over decades of experimentation and improvement in contemporary video editing.

Until now, Filmmaking for Photographers has only been available for purchase as a premium course. But starting this month, MZed Pro members can watch the entirety of the course as part of their annual subscription.
