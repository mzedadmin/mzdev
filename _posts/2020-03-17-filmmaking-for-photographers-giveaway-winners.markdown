We're pleased to announce the winners of the _Filmmaking for Photographers_ Giveaway - thank you to everyone who participated!

What makes this giveaway different from many competitions out there is the lesson from Philip Bloom's [Filmmaking for Photographers course](https://www.mzed.com/courses/filmmaking-for-photographers). [The Movement lesson](https://www.mzed.com/courses/filmmaking-for-photographers/modules/3) is over an hour long and features a vast amount of advice and demonstrations on camera motion in filmmaking. During the giveaway, the lesson was free to watch, and competition entrants had to answer a trivia question from the lesson.

We know people are extremely busy, so the requirement to watch an hour-long video before entering a giveaway is a huge ask. But we've heard from many who entered the competition, watched the Motion lesson, and came away feeling inspired, enlightened, and grateful for the education.

So that's what makes this giveaway so special to us and to our partners. We know each winner on this list is a filmmaker who will get a real use out of the gear. But more importantly, everyone who entered the giveaway learned something new that they can apply to their visual storytelling.
