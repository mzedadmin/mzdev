If you can't justify the cost of anamorphic lenses or adapters, but you still want to play around with the anamorphic look, you're in luck. Anamorphic extraordinaire [Tito Ferradans](https://www.cined.com/how-to-use-anamorphic-lenses-an-interview-with-tito-ferradans/) is back with another video series - along with an ebook guide - and this time it's all about "faking" the anamorphic look without breaking the bank.

"[Anamorfake It Until You Make It](https://www.mzed.com/courses/anamorfake-it-until-you-make-it)" is now available to stream on MZed, and as an exclusive bonus, MZed Pro members can download the companion ebook as well as bonus materials for free.

 

## **How and why fake the anamorphic look?**

While there's no replacement for real anamorphic glass, that enables you to get that ultra-wide shot without an ultra-wide angle look, there are a few ways to get some of the anamorphic looks with the gear you may already have.

For starters, you can simply add letterbox and flare effects in post-production. In the ebook guide, Tito walks you through the process that he uses to fake the anamorphic look in the editing phase.

But if you want to mimic the anamorphic look in camera, there are ways to add oval inserts in front of your lens, in a way that gives you that anamorphic bokeh without losing too much light.
