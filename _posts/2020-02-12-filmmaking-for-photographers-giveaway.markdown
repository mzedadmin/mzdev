To celebrate the release of [Philip Bloom's _Filmmaking for Photographers_ course](https://www.mzed.com/courses/filmmaking-for-photographers), we're hosting a month-long giveaway! In addition to the filmmaking gear prizes listed below, we're also giving away free access to one of the lessons in the course, a one hour primer on camera movement. All the info on how to enter (and gain bonus entries) is below.

But first, here's a short testimonial from a filmmaker who recently watched this amazing course:

> Phillip's superb teaching style, sense of humor, and of course the cats make this an extremely informative and thoroughly enjoyable course. It's had a HUGE impact on how I look at shooting, sound, lighting, and editing. THANK YOU for making this course!

**Filmmaking for Photographers** is a course that Philip has dreamed of doing for a long time, after watching many photographers attempt to move into the video world.

The course is relevant for both photographers and filmmakers who want to learn about camera movement and sequences, lighting styles and challenges, story and narrative, and much more. It's over seven hours of education that eloquently weave hundreds of lessons Philip has learned along his filmmaking journey.

This premium course is available for purchase for $199, or discounted to just $100 for MZed Pro members. But for this giveaway, we're giving away the [Movement lesson](http://www.mzed.com/courses/filmmaking-for-photographers/modules/3) completely free to everyone - all you need to do is [create a free MZed account](https://www.mzed.com/register) and you can watch this one hour lesson immediately. Or if you have an iOS device you can watch it without creating an account in [the MZed app](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/mzed/id1456561064)!

## **MZed Giveaway Prizes**

As you're watching the Movement lesson, make sure to pay close attention, because you could win some of our amazing filmmaking gear prizes too.

All you have to do is answer a question about something from the Movement module, fill out the Gleam competition, and you'll be entered to win the following gifts:

## RØDE VideoMic NTG (5 available)

This microphone packs so many features in it that it may be the last mic you'll ever need. From mounting it on top of your mirrorless or cinema camera, to using it as a USB mic, the [VideoMic NTG](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1521595-REG/rode_vmntg_videomic_ntg_camera_mount_shotgun.html) makes you wonder how you ever lived without it. 

![rode-videomic-ntg](https://mzed-cdn1.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/news/rode-videomic-ntg-giveaway.jpg)There's infinitely variable gain control, an auto sensor that knows if it's connected to a camera or a mobile device, a headphone out, and our favorite, a safety channel that automatically sends a -20db signal to the right channel.

We're excited to be able to give away five of these VideoMic NTG shotgun mics, thanks to RØDE Microphones. Your audio game will be on a completely different playing field.

## Atomos Ninja V

Possibly the most versatile and popular external monitor/recorder out there today, the [Atomos Ninja V](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1401565-REG/atomos_atomnjav01_ninja_v_5_4k.html) will take your camera rig to the next level.

![atomos-ninja-v](https://mzed-cdn1.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/news/atomos-ninja-v-giveaway.jpg)You'll not only be able to monitor your scene using innovative exposure assist tools, you'll also be tapping into your camera's higher quality record settings that are only available with external recording.

And at 5-inches, this monitor will most likely never leave your camera's side (or top). Thank you to Atomos for the gift and for supporting filmmaking education!
