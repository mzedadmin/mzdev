title: How to Shoot Mirror Scenes
---

Mirror, mirror on the wall… Mirrors are an impressive tool in cinematography. Not only do they have the potential for creating fascinating shot compositions and [ambiguous space](https://www.cined.com/types-of-space-in-film-explained-crafting-depth-in-your-cinematic-story/), but they can add another layer to your story through the character's reflection. Reflections themselves pose a big issue, though. Namely, how do you hide your camera and crew? Choosing the right angle is surely a way to do it, but what if you are after rather tricky shots with mirrors? Let's take a look at some examples and ways to execute them!

If you are into cinema history, then you definitely know that mirrors have been a useful tool on set for a while. For instance, filmmakers used them to bounce lights or to create optical illusions (before VFX came around), like adding a ghost by applying a partly reflective transparent mirror. However, that's another topic. Below, we will talk about mirrors that become an actual piece on set and in the shot. And how on earth do filmmakers manage to pull them off?

## Shots with mirrors: Going through

Let's start with the most impressive kind. Imagine we are standing in front of the mirror slightly behind the character (say, over-shoulderish), and looking at their reflection. The camera slowly pushes in and then suddenly goes through the mirror and follows the action in the reflected realm. Do you know what show has made this type of shot into their signature move? I'm talking about "[Euphoria](https://www.hbo.com/euphoria)," of course. We wrote about its [remarkable cinematography](https://www.cined.com/the-remarkable-cinematography-of-euphoria-embracing-the-change-throughout-the-show/) once. This time around, let's focus solely on their tricky mirror transitions, like this one, for example:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cMJQyZTt-Xs" title="Euphoria Mirror Shot feat. Kat | Spotlight" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the dedicated [episode of "The ASC Clubhouse Conversations,"](https://theasc.com/videos/clubhouse-conversations-euphoria) the show's cinematographer, Marcell Rév, breaks down this particular scene and explains how they achieved it. As in similar transitions throughout the series, the mirror in Kat's bathroom is not real. Instead, they use a cut-out wall and duplicate everything, from the smallest items on the vanity to the performance of the actress's body double. The camera, fixed on a crane, goes through the hole and follows the action.

It's an old-school trick, as Marcell Rév calls it, but a fun one. However, something like this requires a lot of effort in preparation and choreography.

## Enhancing the mirror trick

If you want this well-known trick to feel even more mind-blowing, you can combine it with a shot of a real mirror, just like the creators of "[Sucker Punch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/)" did. In the subsequent scene, the camera slowly circles around the characters while they are talking until it reaches Blondie, performed by Vanessa Hudgens. Then, we dive into the mirror and see the girls' reflections from the other side. Impressive, right?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m_IemarLt5c" title="Sucker Punch Mirror Scene" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

How is it possible? The first part of the shot is similar to the "Euphoria" scene, which we discussed before. It's not a real mirror, and we see everything doubled with the actresses sitting on the "reflection" side. After the camera pushes through the mirror, there is a small invisible stitch. At about 01:06, Vanessa's head hides the background, and that's where editors transition into the second shot, filmed using a real mirror. And the trick is sold!

## Where to hide the camera in shots with mirrors?

Let's say you want to spare the effort of building a doubled set, or you need a real mirror and reflection for the shot. What's the best way to hide the camera? The cheapest and easiest one is to frame your character at an angle. Use longer lenses just out of frame, and cheat the actor a bit so that their position looks true on the monitor and not in reality. That works with all kinds of mirrors but needs a bit of fiddling in rehearsal.

![Car mirror shot example from short film](/assets/images/posts/mirror-scenes-car-mirror-example.jpg)
*Using angle and framing to hide the camera in mirror shots. Film still from short "Feed Me" (2023)*

But what if your goal is to film frontally toward the reflection and not off-axis? One example that was much discussed on filmmaker's forums and YouTube channels is a mirror scene from the French-Swedish black horror drama "[Force Majeure](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2121382/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_Force%2520Majeure)" by Ruben Östlund. Just take a look at this still:

![Force Majeure mirror scene with hidden camera](/assets/images/posts/mirror-scenes-force-majeure.jpg)
*Force Majeure hides the camera behind a fake wall with only the lens visible. Film still from "Force Majeure" by Ruben Östlund (2014)*

No way to hide the camera in the reflection, right? In fact, no space to put the camera or the crew there at all. It turns out that the creators built the camera into a fake wall, only with a lens peeking through, and hid themselves behind it as well. Since it's a static shot, in post-production, they only needed to mask out the small circle of lens sticking out. Simple trick, grand effect!

## Legendary shot with a mirror, a girl, and pills

Another shot that has already become a legend in its own right is from the 1997 classic "[Contact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_Contact)" by Robert Zemeckis. You know the one I'm talking about? If not, let's rewatch it together (starting from 00:11):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZD0_5HFMPIg" title="Contact, tricky mirror scene" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When you see this sequence for the first time, it's mesmerizing. You want to rewind the film and watch it again and again, racking your brain trying to figure it out. The first question is: How do you come up with such a shot? (I'm still puzzled and in awe, to be honest). The second: How is it possible to achieve?

Well, not without digital trickery. It is a complex scene that involves a lot of camera motion. But in the end, it's all about the transition into the reflection. Instead of a real mirror, we're dealing with a blue screen here, placed on the cabinet, onto which the first shot from the hall is imposed. Then, it becomes only a matter of careful stitching in post.

## Reciprocal mirror shots

Ready for another astonishing shot? I bet you know this one as well. Yet, do you have any idea how to execute something like this?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iOaD5cZNw0E" title="Black Swan (2010) - She's Trying to Replace Me Scene (4/5) | Movieclips" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Some may think it's all possible through effects and computer-generated images. Nowadays, most filmmakers probably use the mighty rotoscoping for mirror shots and don't bother to hide the camera behind a fake wall. However, it wasn't the approach in this particular sequence from "[Black Swan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_Black%2520Swan)."

VFX artists from the YouTube channel "[Corridor Crew](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=corridor+crew)" found some behind-the-scenes footage and demonstrated the process here. In fact, this scene with Natalie Portman was filmed from behind a reciprocal mirror, also called a one-way mirror. It's a mirror that appears reflective from one side and transparent from another (like we know from interrogation room sequences in films). This way, the creators of "Black Swan" got reflections to form an infinite labyrinth for real. As for the element in the reflection, where she scrapes herself, they filmed it on the green screen, trying to replicate the same camera movement, and then stabilized it and tracked it back into the original shot.

## Practical techniques for mirror shots

Based on these examples, here are the main techniques filmmakers use for mirror shots:

### 1. The duplicate set technique (Euphoria method)

**What it is:** Build two identical sets side by side, with a hole where the mirror should be.

**When to use:** For shots that go "through" the mirror or show impossible camera angles.

**Requirements:** Large stage space, duplicate props, precise choreography.

**Advantages:** Complete creative control, no post-production compositing needed.

**Disadvantages:** Expensive, time-consuming setup, requires large crew.

### 2. Angled camera placement

**What it is:** Position the camera at an angle that keeps it out of the mirror's reflection.

**When to use:** For simple mirror shots where you don't need to see directly into the reflection.

**Requirements:** Understanding of angle of incidence, careful blocking.

**Advantages:** Quick, simple, no special equipment needed.

**Disadvantages:** Limited shot options, may not work for all compositions.

### 3. Hidden camera technique (Force Majeure method)

**What it is:** Build the camera into a wall or set piece, showing only the lens.

**When to use:** For frontal mirror shots where the camera would normally be visible.

**Requirements:** Modifiable set, small camera setup, post-production paint-out work.

**Advantages:** Allows impossible camera positions, relatively simple execution.

**Disadvantages:** Limited to static shots, requires set construction, post-production work.

### 4. Digital replacement method (Contact method)

**What it is:** Replace the mirror with a blue/green screen and composite the reflection in post.

**When to use:** For complex camera moves or when practical methods aren't feasible.

**Requirements:** VFX expertise, careful planning, motion tracking.

**Advantages:** Unlimited creative possibilities, can create impossible reflections.

**Disadvantages:** Expensive post-production, requires VFX team, can look artificial if not done well.

### 5. One-way mirror technique (Black Swan method)

**What it is:** Use a reciprocal mirror that's reflective on one side and transparent on the other.

**When to use:** For creating multiple reflections or infinite mirror effects.

**Requirements:** Specialized mirror equipment, controlled lighting, partial VFX work.

**Advantages:** Creates real optical effects, unique visual possibilities.

**Disadvantages:** Expensive equipment, lighting challenges, may still need VFX enhancement.

## Planning your mirror shots

Before attempting any mirror shot, consider these planning factors:

### Pre-production considerations:

**Script requirements:** What does the mirror shot need to accomplish for the story?

**Budget constraints:** Which techniques are financially feasible for your production?

**Location limitations:** What's possible in your shooting environment?

**Post-production capabilities:** Do you have access to VFX resources?

**Time constraints:** How much prep time do you have for complex setups?

### Technical preparation:

**Storyboard extensively:** Mirror shots require precise visualization.

**Test your approach:** Do small-scale tests before committing to expensive setups.

**Plan for lighting:** Mirrors create complex lighting challenges.

**Consider safety:** Mirror setups can create hazards for cast and crew.

**Backup plans:** Have alternative approaches ready if the primary method fails.

## Working with actors in mirror scenes

Mirror shots often require special considerations for actor performance:

### Performance challenges:

**Spatial confusion:** Actors may struggle with the geography of mirrored setups.

**Eyeline issues:** Where should actors look when interacting with reflections?

**Movement coordination:** Complex choreography may be required for multiple "versions" of the character.

**Emotional continuity:** Maintaining performance quality across technical complexity.

### Solutions:

**Extensive rehearsal:** Practice the choreography until it becomes second nature.

**Clear communication:** Explain the technical setup so actors understand their role.

**Reference monitors:** Show actors what the camera sees to help with positioning.

**Multiple takes:** Technical complexity often requires numerous attempts.

## Modern approaches and digital solutions

Contemporary filmmaking offers new tools for mirror shots:

### Virtual production:

**LED volumes:** Can create realistic mirror reflections using virtual environments.

**Real-time compositing:** Allows directors to see final results during filming.

**Motion capture integration:** Can track both real and reflected performances simultaneously.

### Advanced VFX techniques:

**AI-assisted rotoscoping:** Speeds up the process of isolating elements for compositing.

**Deepfake technology:** Can create convincing digital doubles for reflection work.

**Procedural animation:** Can generate complex mirror behaviors algorithmically.

**Real-time ray tracing:** Creates physically accurate reflections in computer-generated environments.
