We are excited to be partnering up with SIRUI for this New Course Giveaway, as the SIRUI 50mm T2.9 Full Frame Anamorphic Lens has quickly become one of the most popular and affordable anamorphic solutions in the market.

The lens covers a Full-Frame format, and with a maximum aperture of T2.9, good performances even in low-light environments are ensured.

Its squeeze factor of 1.6x results in a 2.8:1 aspect ratio when paired with a 16:9 sensor, and 2.4:1 when shooting in 3:2 mode. This squeeze factor maximizes the sensor resolution and provides the classic blue light streaks.
