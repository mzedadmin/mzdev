title: ARRI Tech Talk Live – Now on MZed
---

If you're into serious filmmaking, you're probably already familiar with the ARRI Tech Talk Live video series over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqORVKxCwMdOvODn1XN2YkwlEpyntpRyG), right? Now [this series is getting a second home at MZed](https://www.mzed.com/courses/arri-tech-talk), where all videos are of course also free to watch.

The ARRI Tech Talk Live video series covers everything from cameras (of course) to lighting, stabilizer systems and accessories, both mechanical and electronic. It's basically a one-stop shop for all things ARRI, with audience questions answered as well.

Simply put, you'll get a vast resource of ARRI-related knowledge, hands-on workshops, and interesting insights into, for example, the history of ALEXA, which just turned 10 years old.

## **ARRI Tech Talk Live series**

Of course, you can watch all the videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqORVKxCwMdOvODn1XN2YkwlEpyntpRyG), but now [ARRI has brought the lectures to MZed](https://www.mzed.com/courses/arri-tech-talk), where they are free for everyone to watch, not just MZed Pro subscribers. That means you don't need anything except an MZed account, no subscription is required - all the videos in the ARRI Tech Talk Live series are completely free.

One upside of [watching the videos on MZed](https://www.mzed.com/courses/arri-tech-talk) is that the sometimes slightly longer videos continue exactly where you left off, so you can watch them as you go along and don't have to keep looking for the right spot.

So you're wondering what's in it? Well, here's a list of all the topics covered in the series so far. Of course, more videos will be added over time. The complete series consists of 23 modules with a total running time of 16h 44m… so far!
