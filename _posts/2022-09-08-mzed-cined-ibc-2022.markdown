## **Reporting news from IBC as always**

CineD has been covering gear and filmmaking industry news at IBC for 13 years, and you can count on a dedicated 4-person team shooting and editing videos about new gear, as well as writing articles, but this is the first year that CineD has its very own booth.

To make your visit worthwhile, everyday at 3pm there will be prize giveaways from partners Angelbird and Lightbridge. And of course, free 30 days of MZed Pro for anyone who visits, while supplies last!

## **CineD & MZed stand at IBC 2022: What can we see there?**

The CineD stand at IBC 2022 serves several purposes: the most important one of course, connecting with CineD audiences as well as MZed Pro members. We are proud to be in the same hall with industry behemoths like ARRI and ZEISS, and just across from the stands of Atlas Lens Co. and SIRUI. 

Come by for a (free) coffee, and a chat. You. can find the CineD stand in Hall 12, in stand 12.A94.

## **Free 30-day full access to MZed Pro filmmaking education for IBC visitors**

We have a great gift for all our visitors of IBC: come and see us to get an MZed folder containing a unique discount code for a free full 30-day access to MZed Pro filmmaking education. This means full access to way more than 300 hours of course content, more than 40 courses (with new ones added regularly!). Just come and see us - you will get a code while supplies last.

Together with Angelbird, we are giving away a set of SD or CFExpress card + reader every day of the show at 3pm! Every day, a winner can chose between:

1x [AV PRO SD MK2 V60 512GB](https://www.angelbird.com/prod/av-pro-sd-mk2-v60-2071/?category=286) & 1x SD Dual Card Reader

On top of that, [LIGHTBRIDGE](https://www.thelightbridge.com) are giving away a [C-Start set of their unique reflectors](https://www.thelightbridge.com/product/c-start2-0/) on every day for the first three days of IBC 2022. Also as part of our daily raffle at 3pm on our stand.

## **How can I win in the daily IBC raffle?**

In order to be eligible to win in the raffle, see one of our staff at the CineD booth (or anywhere on the show floor) to get a raffle ticket to fill out. Hand it back to them and be there (in person!) at our CineD stand 12.A94 at 3pm from Friday Sept 9 until Monday Sept 12, in order to be eligible to win, should we pick your name from the bowl!

The Angelbird and LIGHTBRIDGE prizes will be raffled separately, which means there will be two winners for the first three days of the show. (Only on Monday, there will only be one Angelbird winner.)

Please note that you have to be at our stand in person at 3pm in order to be eligible to win. If you are not there when your name is picked and announced, we will wait only a few minutes and then will draw another winner. 

## **Get your brand and product known - talk to our team at IBC**

We are also at IBC 2022 in order to talk to manufacturers about advertising options with CineD and MZed. We have much to offer and are one of the prime means to get filmmaking technology announcements in front of the right people. Talk to a member of our staff at the CineD stand at 12.A94 about the many advertising and sponsorship options we offer. 

**We look forward to meeting as many as possible of you at the show! Come and see us at the booth, collect your MZed Pro 30-days free pass and take part in our raffle.  **
