          craft and technology of filmmaking, the quality of its courses and its

            Yes! While you could certainly gift an individual course, an MZed
            Pro membership is our most popular gift choice as it gives a year’s
            access to the majority of our education library. You choose when you
            want your gift to be emailed to your giftee, and we’ll also provide
            you with a printable certificate that you can give in person if you
            wish. Learn more here.

            Yes! We have recently introduced a student/education discount of
            20%. To qualify for this discount you need to be currently enrolled
            in a relevant education program, and provide a scan or photo of a
            student ID that shows a valid date. We also provide discounts for
            staff and academics in relevant programs. Please contact us with the
            above details and we can arrange the custom discount for you.
