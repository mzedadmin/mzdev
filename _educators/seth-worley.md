  Seth Worley is the writer/director of short films and branded content for clients like JJ Abrams's Bad Robot, Red Giant, Film Riot, Sandwich Video, and Steve Taylor.

  Known for his ability to balance character-driven comedy with high-concept spectacle, his short films include the genre-bending/Webby-winning Plot Device, Seussian fable Old/New: Narrated by Patton Oswalt, dark comedy Real Gone (winner of the Music Bed Film Festival judge's choice award), sci-fi action set piece Tempo (one of Slate's \"Six Best Sci-Fi Shorts of 2012\"), and the \"24-meets-Take-Your-Daughter-To-Work-Day\" dramedy Form 17.

  In 2017, he co-founded the company Plot Devices to manufacture tools and resources for screenwriters and story nerds. The company's first product, the Storyclock Notebook, was brought to life by 5,354 Kickstarter backers, raising over $120,000 in 30 days.
