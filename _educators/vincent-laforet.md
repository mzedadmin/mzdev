bio: |-
  Vincent Laforet is among the most influential pioneers working in contemporary photography and film today. His unique commercials for such well-known brands as Apple, Nike, General Electric, CNN, and Canon, and his groundbreaking photography for magazines such as National Geographic, Vanity Fair, and Sports Illustrated, to name just a few, cover a broad spectrum of subjects and narratives. Yet a common thread runs through his work: It always features cutting-edge technologies that make the photographs and films inventive, iconic and unforgettable.

  As a visual thought leader, Laforet is deliberate and direct in how he talks about his work and teaches his craft, whether speaking to millions on national news networks, like CBS Sunday Morning, or working one-on-one with directors and photographers in film or photo workshops. He's also a popular speaker at media, photo and film conventions, and is a highly sought-after advisor to start-up Silicon Valley companies.

  His success in traditional media has also made him one of the most recognizable photographers in the world of social media: More than 40 million people online have seen and shared his mesmerizing, high-altitude, nocturnal, aerial photos of cities around the world, which have been collected and published in his photography book, Air.
