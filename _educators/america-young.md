The projects she has helmed have a wide range from a drag queen comedy to sci-fi action to fantasy action to coming of age drama to exploring domestic violence in a superhero universe.

  Her second feature, \"Back to Lyla\" which is Alice in Wonderland meets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind inspired, and will be released later this year. Upon completion of the Warner Bros directing program, she successfully entered the TV world, directing an episode of Blindspot (aired May, 2020) and Legacies (aired 1/23/20) with glowing feedback from both teams. She has now also directed episodes for Roswell and Kung fu. And at the end of 2021 she directed the pilot of Surfside Girls for Apple TV which got a full season order and will release in 2022.

  She is a proud founder of The Chimaera Project, a nonprofit that gives opportunities to women in the film & media arts.
