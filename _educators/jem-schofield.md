  Jem Schofield is a producer, DP and educator and the founder of theC47, a full-service production company that focuses on video production, filmmaking, consulting & education. He started this journey as a kid (barely double digits) with a used Pentax K-1000. It was a great start to his education in this field, and nowadays he spends most of his time producing content, educating others and otherwise being borderline obsessed with cameras, production and the craft of lighting.

  For over 20 years Jem has produced projects and provided training for an ever-expanding client base. Current and past clients include AbelCine, Apple, Inc., ARRI, Canon, Corus Entertainment, LinkedIn Learning, MAC Group, MZed, NBCUniversal, NPR, PBS, Riverbed Technologies, Scottish Enterprise, Sony, TED, The Vitec Group, Walmart Films, Westcott, YouTube and Zeiss. Jem is also an equipment design consultant to many manufacturers in the film and television industry. He designed theC47 DP Kit & theC47 Book Light Kit (geared towards corporate, in-house and small to no crew productions), which is based on FJ Westcott's Scrim Jim Cine system.
