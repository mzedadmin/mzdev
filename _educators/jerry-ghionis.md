bio: |-
    Jerry Ghionis is widely celebrated as being among the top five best wedding photographers in the world. He has emerged as one of the most influential wedding photographers of the 21st century. Inheriting the strong european sense of style and panache that's synonymous with the Greek culture, combined with the relaxed Australian sensibility, Jerry and his wife, Melissa, are based in Melbourne, Australia and Beverly Hills, USA. Together they travel frequently on international photography assignments and speaking engagements. Married in January 2011, Jerry and Melissa work as a team and have developed a powerful creative and business force.

    With the flair of a fashion designer and the ingenuity of an architect, his style can be described as vintage glamour meets contemporary fashion. Renowned for his creativity, he not only has the ability to capture natural magic on a wedding day but he creates magic of his own. His love and empathy for people creates powerful visual storytelling. With the innate ability to make everyone look and feel beautiful in front of his camera, Jerry's images are often simple yet a complex blend of soul, drama, imagination and technical skill. Whether he is shooting a glamour session, lifestyle portrait or a boudoir beauty, Jerry has the ability to bring out the best in any situation.

    Although his signature style is recognizable, Jerry has reinvented himself countless times over the 21 years he has been shooting professionally. He has been described as predictably unpredictable. Just when you think his work has reached its limits he surprises you with yet another reinvention.
