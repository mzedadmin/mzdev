name: Tito Ferradans
bio: |-
  Hailing from Brazil, Tito Ferradans spent the last ten years pursuing the dream of making films. Tito is a tech guy, passionate for sci-fi narratives and with a sharp eye for the visual aspects of a story, from cinematography to post-production and visual effects. 
  
  He also has a YouTube channel about anamorphic lenses, which has been his study subject since 2012 and very likely the reason you're here!
