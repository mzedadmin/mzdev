  With over 24 years of successfully providing a window into the world of filmmaking, the International Film Institute of New York continues to inspire and support individuals on their journey toward either a higher education in film or a foundation to building a career in the industry in a conservatory setting focused on storytelling.

  The International Film Institute was created to provide intensive, comprehensive, and quality training in the art and craft of cinematic story telling including, but not limited to, screenwriting, directing, production, and editing lead to the creation of a short film by each student. In addition to learning the technical disciplines and aesthetic principles of filmmaking, students also watch and discuss classic films being given, thereby, a sense of the historical and culture context of motion pictures in our society. Filmmaking – narrative, documentary, or experimental – is a collaborative endeavor and developing that skill, which will serve them well in the industry and beyond, will be an essential component of their experience at IFI.
