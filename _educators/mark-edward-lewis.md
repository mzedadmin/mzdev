bio: |-
  After nearly 30 years of writing and producing musical scores, re-recording mixing, developing sound design, editing, writing and directing, Mark Edward Lewis has a unique perspective on how to create high production value for independent productions.

  What makes Mark an invaluable resource is his mastery of all aspects of audio production. One of the new breed of directors who approaches storytelling from an \"audio first\" perspective, Mark's projects have a flow, pacing and emotional impact that few directors possess. Always strongly adhering to the axiom, \"Post production begins in pre-production\" Mark has righted many adrift productions with his organization, creativity, ingenuity, and cross-discipline experience.

  Mark has worked professionally in nearly every area of production and post production including event development, most recently as a post-production supervisor on the Avenger's S.T.A.T.I.O.N. with Frank Serafine. In 2016, he was the main presenter for the \"Sound Advice\" tour in North America and Australia where he taught over 1,200 filmmakers about improving their production value with better sound.

  Mark is also a published writer on the subject of live audio mixing with his book \"Audio Mixer's Secret Handbook: Live Audio Alchemy\". He currently martials his deep knowledge of post production and works in Los Angeles as both a filmmaker and producer of episodic series, currently directing and producing the sci-fi series \"Blade of Honor\" and the supernatural Western \"Silver City.\"
