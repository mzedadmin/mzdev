bio: |-
  Lesley Powers is a narrative director and pitch deck designer based in Los Angeles. As a content creator herself, she knows how to take another creator's vision and put pen to paper or mouse to Photoshop. Pitch decks are a niche that Powers describes as a digital vision board. The collaboration between graphic designer and creator is so important. Entrusting someone to give life to your story is no small feat, and one Powers takes very seriously.

  In the world of directing - she's currently directing the brand new web series - This is a Lot. Guest stars include John Michael Higgins, Jane Kaczmarek, and Dot-Marie Jones. She collaborates with the show's creator (and childhood friend) to bring a fresh perspective to the \"joys\" of motherhood. A mother herself to a toddler, Powers understands ways to find comedy in the chaos. She recently completed Sundance's Co//ab for Directing Actors. An invaluable experience! Her latest short film, Don't Tell Mom, was a Top 10 Jury Picked finalist in the SheDirected competition (helmed by Kate Bosworth). Powers, a former panel coordinator for the Bentonville Film Festival is a big believer in the festivals' mission of diversity and inclusion. She had a 98% female crew on her 2018 short film, Make Yourself at Home. Her first short film, Mr. Johnson's Julius Caesar, made her a Nashville Film Festival 2015 Horizon Award nominee and sparked her directing journey.

  Powers is a graduate of Indiana University and paid homage to her hometown of Indianapolis by naming her production company, Naptown Entertainment. She resides in Los Angeles with her husband and son, loves funfetti cupcakes and watching Sex and the City re-runs.
